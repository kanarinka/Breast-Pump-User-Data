#Breast Pump User Data
This repo has data for use at the Make the Breast Pump Not Suck Hackathon at the MIT Media Lab on Sept 20-21, 2014. 

## Breast Pump Reviews
In the directory /pumpreviews/. This dataset is generously provided by Weespring. There are three CSVs in this data set.

## User submitted stories and ideas 
Hundreds of users have submitted ideas for how to improve the breast pump. At the moment we have a subset of these uploaded in the repo. We hope to have all the ideas in the repo by the evening of Friday, Sept 19th. Some of the ideas are short and singular but other ideas are long, personal stories. All are in the form of unstructured text files. Each user submission is a single .txt file.
