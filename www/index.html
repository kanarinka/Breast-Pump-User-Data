    <p class="lead">We want to seed ideas, connections and projects that will make the breast pump experience not suck so much. Covening talented people for a weekend is a first step. We also see this as an opportunity to catalyze innovation in maternal and pediatric health more generally.

    <h2 class="featurette-heading">What's a hackathon?</h2>
    <p class="lead">A hackathon is a high-energy, collaborative event that seeks to bring together a diverse group of people to explore key issues and challenges in a particular field. Traditionally, hackathons have been mostly technical in nature, focusing on software engineering and, occasionally, on hardware development; our goal is to reach out to a wider range of talents and skills to investigate creative solutions for the maternal and neonatal healthcare space.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="featurette">
    <h2 class="featurette-heading">Who's coming?</h2>
    <p class="lead">150 people that will self-organize into teams of 5-10 people per team. For our hackathon teams, we are looking for a mix of breastpump users, engineers, designers, health care and lactation specialists, and educators. Registration is free and open to the public but space is limited. You must <a href="http://bit.ly/makethebreastpumpnotsuck">register</a> in order to attend and unfortunately all of our space is now full. </p>

     <p class="lead">We are a group of MIT Media Lab students and researchers who are also parents:</p>

<p><strong>Tal Achituv</strong> is a Research Assistant in the Fluid Interfaces group. His background is in hardware and software engineering and he has founded several companies. He is the father of Shira (2), and Lior who was born just last month. (@achituv)</p>

<p><strong>Catherine D'Ignazio</strong> is a Research Affiliate in the Civic Media group. She is also an Assistant Professor of Civic Media and Data Visualization at Emerson College and a Fellow at the Engagement Lab. Her background is in the arts, data visualization and software development. She likes making fun, magical things with social impact. She has three kids and has pumped for all three. Her youngest is 14 months old and hung out at the Media Lab for the first 6 months of her life. (@kanarinka)</p>

<p><strong>Alexis Hope</strong>  is a Research Assistant in the Civic Media group. Her background is in human-centered design, qualitative research, and maternal health. Prior to coming to the lab, she worked on a project to build a low-cost, easy-to-use ultrasound system for midwives in Kenya and Uganda. She has no kids yet, but hopes that by the time she does there is a better breast pump! (@alexishope)</p>

<p><strong>Taylor Levy</strong>  is a Research Assistant in the Playful Systems group. Her background is in industrial design and graphics. She had a baby named Pau ("POW") just six weeks ago. </p>

<p><strong>Alexandra Metral</strong>  is a Research Affiliate in the Fluid Interfaces group. (The irony of the group’s name is not lost on her.) She is an artist/designer/local politician/stylist/educator, and also has experience running start-up ventures. Idea Translation, Life-Extension and Fun are common features of her work. She has nursed her three young children, the first with chronic illnesses which presented in nicu. Also pumped for an adopted neighbor. Alexandra and her family are bi-coastal, silicon valley is her other pod. (@alexmetral)</p>

<p><strong>Dave Raymond</strong> is an honorary member of the Civic Media group and the Director of Training and Business Development for Vecna Technologies. He manages their multimillion dollar digital technology rollout to the VA Hospital System and loves improving health care for veterans. He has three kids and embraces the insanity by playing in a heavy metal band.</p>

<p><strong>Che-Wei Wang</strong>  is a Research Assistant in the Playful Systems group. He is baby Pau's dad and a whiz with hardware design and development.</p>

    <h2 class="featurette-heading">Why is this awesome?</h2>
    <p class="lead">As one of the midwives at our first hackathon said, "Maternal health lags behind other sectors for innovation." We are bringing together people from diverse fields, sectors and backgrounds to take a crack at making life better for moms, babies and new families. We see our role as a catalyst for new connections and new ideas that will inspire participants and highlight maternal and pediatric health as a vibrant, exciting space to be working in for the design and engineering leaders of tomorrow.

  <div class="featurette">
    <h2 class="featurette-heading">Why is breastmilk magic?</h2>
    <p class="lead">The health benefits of breastfeeding (both to mother and baby!) are numerous and include the reductions of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, obesity, female cancers, heart disease and osteoporosis. Despite the overwhelming data and worldwide endorsement of breastfeeding for at least two years, many women do not breastfeed at all or wean after several months. In particular, low-income, working women are rarely able to take extended maternity leave, to afford the cost of a pump, or to pump breastmilk at their workplace. In emerging economies around the world, women who go back to work wean their babies rather than using a breast pump.

    <p class="lead">
      <ol>
<li><strong>Submit your ideas!</strong> <a href="http://breastpump.media.mit.edu/idea.php">Click here to send us your best ideas</a>. We are compiling an amazing, open data set of hundreds of creative, awesome ideas from pumping moms (and trans-dads). Teams will be reading about your responses and ideas at the hackathon.</li>
<li><strong>Donate your breast pumps.</strong> Bring your old pumps to the third floor of the MIT Media Lab, corner of Ames & Amherst St, in Cambridge. There is a donation box for pumps we can use at the hackathon.</li>
<li><strong>Get some media attention for the event in your locale.</strong> Part of this is about raising the profile of maternal health and bringing public attention to the idea that there are so many ways that our society could better support families and children.</li>
<li><strong>Show up.</strong> If in Boston, you can come by the hackathon at 5pm on Saturday to give teams feedback on their ideas. You can come listen to the final team pitches from 4pm - 6:30pm on Sunday and see who wins the grand prize, too. </li>
<li><strong>Connect with us post-hackathon.</strong> We are a little overwhelmed right now but afterwards we will be looking for ways to keep the momentum going.</li>

<li><strong>Help us analyze and visualize the user-submitted ideas.</strong> Do you have data visualization or NLP skills? <a href="mailto:breastpump-organizers@media.mit.edu">Email us</a> and we'll send you the data set of amazing, creative ideas submitted by pump users. We'd love some innovative visualizations and ways to group and categorize the unstructured text.

    <h2 class="featurette-heading">What's the structure of the event?</h2>
    <p class="lead">Our program will begin with introductions and inspirational talks from our sponsors and guest speakers.  Next, hackathon registrants will provide brief “rocket pitches” about any idea they want to work on, inviting attendees to join their teams and share their skills.  Once teams are created, the hacking begins.  Problems are explored, ideas are shared, and innovative solutions are crafted.  All meals, water, coffee, and tea will be provided to properly fuel our collaboration.  We'll also have a bunch of awesome tech on hand - 3D printers, wearable prototyping materials, arduinos, Raspberry Pis and more. What teams create is theirs to keep.</p>

    <p class="lead">At the end of Day 1, each team will provide a brief update of their progress before adjourning for the evening.  Additional venues for collaboration will be provided for teams that wish to collaborate past the official Day 1 wrap-up time of 7pm.  Day 2 will feature continuing collaboration through most of the day.  Teams will present their ideas before a panel of expert judges, who will award prizes for the four most promising projects before the event comes to a close.
