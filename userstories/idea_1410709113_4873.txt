I thought my insurance-covered Medela worked fine until I read these comments. Now I'm thinking it may have not been strong enough and that could be a contributing factor to the supply issues I have had. 

Plus, all the other issues still stand (hard to clean, suction varies and is sometimes terrible, no timer, etc, etc)
