The flanges are rarely clear. It's difficult to see where your nipple is positioned inside the flange. The flanges are really damn hard and scrapy. Pumping is really hard for moms whose nipples are at the bottom of their breast rather than centered and for moms with really large breasts. Moms need to be able to pump while they are walking around. Pumping makes loud, indiscreet noises. Pumping isn't sexy. Pumps are a pain in the ass to clean -- and the most important components are easy to lose and rip. It's really hard to attach yourself to the pump and then turn the damn thing on. There's a steep learning curve. Pumping sucks and I'm so thrilled you're taking this on!!
