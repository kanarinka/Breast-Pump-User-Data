Creating soft breast shields that would naturally stick, fit, and adapt to any nipple (I mean it's not like your baby comes with the right mouth for your nipple so why have different sizes of breast shields?) - also a soft material that would be warm/warm up when in use (with the temp of your skin for ex.) as opposed to the cold hard plastic now used.
