There was a pump called the Whisper Wear that was the best idea, but the company folded. Perhaps that company didn't have the wealth of creativity and knowledge represented in your group.

The great idea was that it could be worn while working, making it perfect for an ER physician or someone with no access or time to leave the work zone and go pump.

This is what is needed! Warm and fuzzy is nice, but ease and convenience is most important.
