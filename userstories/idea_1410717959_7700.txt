I always thought, it there a breast pump that could maybe simultaneously as you are pumping it is going into some kind of bottle where the baby could be feeding from the attach bottle, kind of continuous flow.  When would i use this.  in the car on a long trip, where i can't take the baby out of the car seat.  Or for those moms that can not breast feed.  Eliminates the need to refrigerate or store the milk...  etc...
