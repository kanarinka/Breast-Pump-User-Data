I'm really excited to see that the poor state of breast pump technology is on MIT's radar.  I would be very interested in hearing updates or providing insight along the way.

I'm actively involved in and have strong networks in the breastfeeding community at the national, state and local level.  I look at this issue through a business lens with particular insight into how use technology (not hardware) to coordinate care.  This is a field and subject area that is extremely behind the times and could greatly benefit from others coming to the table.
