Just read about your Breast Pump Hackathon and am quite fascinated by what you are up to.

My name is Kathleen S Chiu, IBCLC, RLC and I have been a lactation consultant since 1987.  Moreover, I have specialized in breast pump and breastfeeding product development.  I worked for Ameda/Egnell from 1987 to 1991, eventually becoming head of Product Development and part of the team working on the development of the first one-handed breast pump, the Ameda Elite hospital grade pump, the Flexishield, and the Ameda breast shell system.

From 2001 to 2003, I was National Director of Sales and Marketing for Whisper Wear, the first wearable breast pump, and was involved with the design and patenting of that pump.

I have also worked for Hygiea, which has one of the most robust pumps on the market today.

I am now semi-retired and doing private practice/part-time, as well as hold positions on the boards of the Georgia Breastfeeding Coalition (GBC) and the Southeastern Lactation Consultants Association (SELCA), and this project FASCINATES me!  Please keep me informed.
