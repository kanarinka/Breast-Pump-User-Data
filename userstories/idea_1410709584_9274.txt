DREAM to be able to walk around a public area pumping, hands free and NO ONE CAN TELL. To leave yourself 'hooked up' for the work day and just flip a switch on and off. Or even just set a timer (with a warning-yikes) and pump while you work thought the day at appropriate intervals. To pump while laying down sleeping.
