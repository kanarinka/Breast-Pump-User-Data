As some background, I've pumped from 12 weeks (1st child) and 7 weeks (2nd child) to over a year old for my children who both received only breast milk until after their first birthday.  I used an Ameda Purely Yours double electric pump for the first child, and a Medela Pump in Style double electric pump for the second child.

As a working mom now expecting a 3rd child, the most helpful thing to me would be either:
* a more efficient pump that would allow me to have to spend less time pumping
* a smaller pump that somehow required less privacy so I wouldn't have to find special rooms (or tolerate an ugly bathroom) for pumping.  Imagine something like the flat sticker-like things they use in an EKG.  If a pump were like this and somehow discrete in other ways (e.g. not as loud), maybe I could pump discretely in a semi-private cubicle.
