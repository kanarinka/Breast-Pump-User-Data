A few potential suggestions:
1) Create a pump that can be warn at night and the mother can go to sleep, and the pump will run every two hours without her needing to wake up - sort of like an insulin pump
2) create a bra that can be worn with the pump (making it hands free) that has webbing/compression/rollers to express and massage to maximize output

I'm guessing this is out of scope but... Many women are worrie. About milk output during feeding - perhaps there's a way to integrate a flow meter in a nipple shield which has a wireless transmitter that integrates to an app (not these should be warn all the time - but it would give a way for a mother to occasionally get a read on an amount).
