Love what you guys are doing (and the mention of the Gates Foundation’s grand challenge in one of your media posts!).
 
I’m a new (pumping) mom, also a new member of the Northwest Mother’s Milk Bank board, and also work at the Gates Foundation so we have a lot in common.  I’ve been talking about a hackathon or new business for better breast pumps for the better part of the past year and am so glad to see you doing this.
 
I travel a lot.  So in addition to the great suggestions you’ve already gotten, breast pumps need to travel better.  So many women have blown out their pumps while trying to pump in foreign countries dealing with really bad power converters or step-down transformers.  Not only do they lose the ability to pump, sometimes they kill their pump altogether.  And bringing an extra battery – good luck! Unless you are able to borrow from some mom who no longer needs her pump’s battery, you are stuck buying a new $80 battery on your own or lugging a AAA battery pack pump attachment with you in your suitcase (also expensive).
 
Will send more ideas if I think of any.  Would love to connect more to see how it all goes – either on behalf of the Northwest Mother’s Milk Bank or the Gates Foundation.
