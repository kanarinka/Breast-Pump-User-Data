The hardest part about pumping at work is smoothly removing the flanges from my breasts and setting the bottles on my desk - I'm trying to make sure milk doesn't drip on my clothes and simultaneously trying to keep the bottle/flange upright on the desk without the tube pulling them over. I'm a teacher and try to pump in between classes (10 min) so I need my pumping process to be at simple and quick as possible.
