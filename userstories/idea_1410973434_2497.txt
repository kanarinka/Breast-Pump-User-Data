A slim, flexible shield that uses mechanical compression rather than negative pressure to stimulate milk flow.

Shield placement that reaches more ducts more evenly and better simulates infant suckling as opposed to steady, intense tugging.

Allow milk collection to take place underneath, rather than out front, then flow away.

Shield and flow system that will fit into the dimensions of a push-up bra, or that have the shape of a push-up pad and can fit into any standard bra.

Self-cleaning: submerge cups in soapy water and activate to clean automatically; repeat with clean water to rinse; auto-dry.

Fully silent operation.

Hands-free every time, no exceptions.
