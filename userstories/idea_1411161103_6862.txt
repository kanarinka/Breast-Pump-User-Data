this is a great idea to change the pump!

1. universal plug is a great idea.  what about plugging it into a usb port to charge or usb adapter.

2. hands free so you can multitask.

3. smaller unit at breast and some type of collection that could attach lower so not as obvious when pumping and less bulky.  the occasional times i do pump, i typically also nurse my little one on one side and still try to type at my computer.  Now that she is bigger, the problem is she takes up more space and kicks at the pump that has a bottle attached to the unit for collection.

4. quick setup. a lot of my friends are teachers and have a very small break (prep period & lunch) before kids come back into their room.

5. easy to clean especially when away from home. traveling, being a teacher.

6. when done, you have to throw the unit away, because not safe (clean) for next mom.  have most of the parts able to be sanitized or reused.

thanks!
