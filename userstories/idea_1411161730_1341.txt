I exclusively pumped for 11 monthsâ€¦ 11 long months.  Here is an idea that would have made things much better.  The base of one of the bottles should have an alternate bottom which screws on as a nipple.   If the positioning is engineered right, you can bottle feed baby and pump at the same time.  This would be good for moms who exclusively pump, and also a big time saver for moms who nurse, then pump afterwards.
