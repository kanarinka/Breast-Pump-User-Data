Please make me WANT to pump! 

Simplify clean-up (which currently takes just as long as pumping itself)
Make machine quieter
Collection devices currently get in the way so even with hands-free bra I can't work on computer or anything
Make portable! If baby cries and I'm pumping I can't get up to pick him up
