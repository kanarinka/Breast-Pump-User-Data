Needs
1. Easy to clean (one piece without corners or overhangs where milk can build up).
2. Hospital grade that is affordable and small. Statics show that lower income mothers don't nurse- which is crazy because your milk is free! Why? The pumps are expensive. My ameda platinum is $100 a month rented or $1300.
3. I transfer my pumped milk 2-4 times! Examples:
A- pump in 1. Transfer 1 to 2 ( milk bag for freezing). Transfer 2 to 3 to serve to baby.
4. Hospital grade pumps can't be used with batteries.
4. My medela pump and style and ameda pure both are weaker when used with batteries.

Ideas
1. Compact milk container inside that I empty and separate into bags once I get home.
2. Pump directly into bag (not those cheap clips that spray milk everywhere)
3. More compact (ameda pure is close but not easy to clean)
