Someone posted about your project on a mom's group here in the bay area (PAMP), and I had to respond.  Love what you are you are doing!  I am nearing the end of pumping with my second (now 6 months), and I wish I could go on longer but it's just too hard.  So here are my thoughts:

- I go through a lot of plastic bags for parts and it feels so wasteful.  I put clean ones in a clean bag (because my pump bag has gotten pretty gross and I don't like to have the parts floating in there).  I try to reuse the clean one a bunch of times, but eventually something happens and it gets dirty too.  Then I have a dirty bag that I throw the used parts into after I'm done, because I don't have a sink where I am pumping, and I don't want to spend time wiping etc.  (I have two sets of parts so I can pump twice without taking time at work to wash.)  I rinse out the dirty bag at night so I can reuse it, but after a while it becomes pretty gross - found mold in one once.  Anyway, I would love a nice, compact, plastic washable box that specifically fits the parts and is easy to clean.  I could wash it along with the parts every night.  Would seriously love that.
Alternatively, with my last baby, I had a mini fridge of my own in my office, so I would just put the parts in the fridge so that I could use them again later in the day without washing.  (I would always get a cup of tea before to the second pumping session, and hold the cold flanges over it to warm them up before sticking them on...)  But in my new office, I only have access to our shared fridge, so as much as I'm open about the fact that I'm pumping, I don't think my coworkers need to actually see pump parts in a plastic bag next to their lunch.  So an opaque box would again be awesome.

- I find that squeezing / massaging each breast while pumping, especially towards the end, really helps both speed things up and get the last bit out that might not have otherwise come out with just the pump.  But the hard plastic flanges make it a little difficult.  If the flanges were really soft, and you could just massage over them, that would be nice.

Hope that's helpful to your project!  Feel free to share these thoughts around if they help other moms as well.
