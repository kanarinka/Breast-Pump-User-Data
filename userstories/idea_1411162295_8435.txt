This is such a cool idea, thanks for doing it.

My ideas:

Make the pump like a pack you can wear so you can hold your baby or do things around the house while pumping.

Make the parts that connect to the shield smaller, they stick out so far.

Make it easier to pump into storage bags, instead of bottles. 

Thanks again!
