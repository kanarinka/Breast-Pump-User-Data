I don't have a hands-free pump, and since I literally have to hold them up, I would like the option to change the suction strength or the speed on the actual flange, or without having to set the bottles down. I was also thinking since massage is important, maybe including some sort of breast massage tool to accompany the product to assist with stubborn let-down. I pump 3 times a day at work, and anything that could make this process easier would be fantastic.
