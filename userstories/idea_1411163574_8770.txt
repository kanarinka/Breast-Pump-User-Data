Hi! I wanted to cry out HOORAY when I read that you were tackling breast pumps!! I'm a working mother of an 8 month old and have been in the medical device industry for some time. When I first saw a breast pump I was wondering if it was a joke. Anyway, one of the problems I'd like to see improved is that I usually have to manually combine my right and left bottles after I'm done pumping. Baby eats from both sides when I nurse him, so I combine both bottles after pumping. This involves detaching both bottles from my boobs, tapping the adapter piece into each bottle (can't lose those drops that are in the adapter!!), pouring one bottle into the other while hoping the flanges (which    I'm still wearing at this point) won't drip onto my nice work outfit. This introduces the chance of contamination, spills, drips onto clothing, etc.

It would be nice to have the option to have both left and right sides drain into the same bottle, and also to not have as much residual milk stuck in the flanges and adapters.

Anyway, good luck!! You're really tackling a great problem.
