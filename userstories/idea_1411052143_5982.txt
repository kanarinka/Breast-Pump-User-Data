*Fewer parts!  The number of times I have forgotten some critical component for pumping is unreal.  There are so many of them to clean and keep track of.  
*Quieter!  When my boss rang my phone while I was pumping, he asked is I was printing money, the background noise was so loud.
*It would be amazing if I could do breast compressions through the flange.  Right now, I can only compress on the outside edge, otherwise I break the suction.  
*Turning the pump on/off while holding it to the breast would be so helpful.  For women struggling to find time to pump, a common suggestion is to pump one breast while feeding the baby from the other.  Except, where do you find the hands to pick up and hold the baby to one, while turning on and holding the pump to the other?  If I could pick up the flange, arrange on my breast, and turn on one-handed, it would be so helpful.
*Timer on pump that would increase suction/stimulate letdown/turn off, etc.  Maybe self-learning, so the mom would do it manually until the pump learned her needs and habits?
