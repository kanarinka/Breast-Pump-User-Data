I would like to submit that the pump have some type of chip built in that can record how long a mom pumps and maybe then either a place to enter the amount or an accompanying phone/computer app that can ask for amount. This would be particularly important for moms with preemies who need to keep logs. It also would be helpful for providers since a mom could provide a log that shows how often she pumps and how much she gets. This information could be used to better counsel mothers about pumping and to identify and address problems early. For example a mom who consistently gets dramatic difference in milk output per breast would be an indicator of an underlying medical condition that might impact her ability to meet her breastfeeding goals. I should note when entering amount of milk, it is important to be able to enter per breast.
