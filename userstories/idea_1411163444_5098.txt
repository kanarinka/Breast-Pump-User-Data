Unfortunately,
I’m learning about this too late to attend. L As a lactation consultant and a working mom I can truly relate to the hassles of pumping. I would love to lay down and pump, or not have to hold them to my breast, maybe even a voice activated pump that switched pressure and cycles on demand, super efficient that shortens the time required to pump… I could go on, just like every other mother on the milk production train.
I hope this event helps to find a way to make these pumps turn from foe to friend!
I can’t wait to see what turns up!!!
Thank you!
