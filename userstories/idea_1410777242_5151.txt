personally, I think hand expression is easiest, fastest and most comfortable (forget about aesthetics!).
The pumping cone only covers the nipple. Alas, the whole breast contains milk and is not just a full bag. When doing it by hand you can massage the whole breast to bring the milk up from "the bottom" and even from glands that are in the underarm area. (Think of how babies nuzzle and push with their hands and how kittens need their mother's teats.) The pump should thus in some way be able to help with that massage... unfortunately it would make it less compact. The best: better lactation consulting IN the hospital or clinic... Good luck!
