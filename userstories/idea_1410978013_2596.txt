Smaller, quieter, and lighter! I never used the insulated cooler section, so that could go. 

Fewer parts that are easier to clean. 

A variety of sizes of breast shields -- breasts come in numerous sizes, so why don't the shields? 

More attractive and easier-to-use interface -- it costs more than an iPod, so why can't it look like one?

More colors -- mine was an ugly hospital-style beige.

(FYI: I used the Medela Pump in Style for a year.)
