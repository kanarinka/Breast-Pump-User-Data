I absolutely love my ACA tan Medela PIS. I have EP'd for over 7 months now (after 6 weeks.of nursing). I can fit all my parts in it, it has a cooler area attached, and I've had no problems at all with suction or the motor. Most people think it's my lunch bag. Of course, it's not the same as the symphony (they're different machines), but it works for me. I've also found that compression, massage, and a hands free bra are a must!
