I am a labor and delivery nurse and taking time to pump is extremely difficult. If the status of my patient changes, I have to go to the bedside immediately,  even mid pumping. I would love a pump that could easily be concealed under clothing. Also it would need to be almost silent. Maybe under a jacket, scarf, etc. Thank you!
