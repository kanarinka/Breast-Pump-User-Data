PJ's comfort are also hospital grade and only weigh 1.5 pounds. But I feel you. I rented a Medela classic for awhile before I found a pump that suited me better. It was 22 pounds. Definitely could NOT take that one to work. (It's the same as the one Will Ferrell was sporting on the red carpet a few years ago.)
