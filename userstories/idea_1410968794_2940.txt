-The breast pump should be visually personalizable, like cell phone covers. I would love to look at photos of my sweet baby to stimulate let down.
- Every pump should have a timer so that I don't have to use a separate app on my phone!
- It would be great if the pump could track the amount of milk expressed. 

Thank you for doing this hackathon! I can't wait to hear the results! As the mom of a preemie, I was unable to breastfeed him for the first seven weeks of his life and the pump was my life. I hope that moms in the future will have a better pump to attach themselves to!

Love,
