Hi Breast Pump Hackathon Organizers! I hope my story helps someone improve the pump! 

When my son was born I needed to pump to bring my milk supply in. After we got home, I needed to pump to increase my supply and try to reduce a formula supplement. 

A newborn feeds every two to three hours. Our first 3 months together were a hectic cycle of feed, pump, wash pump parts, repeat. Fortunately I had help and someone could look after my son while I pumped. However, many moms in my lactation support groups at NWH and MGH found it difficult to pump while being the sole caretaker of a newborn. The pump parts get in the way when holding a baby! And pumping and washing take time!

The Medela Freestyle moved the membrane to the breasts and shrunk the motor to something that could be worn at the waist. If the collection bottles were also moved to the waist everything could hide under clothing. 

Now that I'm back at work, a pump that I can hide under clothing would be welcome! Breast milk is stable at room temperature for up to six hours. If I could just leave the pump in my bra and swap out collection bottles at the waist the set up would last for three pumps!

Comment: pumps like the Freemie don't work for me because I only pump an ounce at a time. The Medela system at least lets me stick with smaller bottles that match my supply.
