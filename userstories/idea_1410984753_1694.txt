When I gave birth, I had inverted nipples. Doctors had told me for 20 years (since high school!) that breastfeeding would be difficult for me. The pump, along with horrible nipple shields, allowed my nipples to "evert." It took 12 weeks, and the day before I went back to work, my lactation consultant and I finally got rid of the nipple shields. I was then able to nurse my son naturally, which created a much better bond between us. (Before that breastfeeding was a fight, and he thought bottles were wonderful. It was a really difficult process.)

While the pump really helped correct my nipples, it was a painful several weeks. I had blisters, redness, and infections. You could see the cracks, and sometimes my son would spit up blood in the milk. Part of this may have been the shields, but part might also have been the way that the pump worked. If there were a gentler way to improve this process, it would help a lot of women who give up breastfeeding due to inverted nipples.

I also credit the pump as being something that allowed me to push through the most painful periods, knowing that my milk supply would still be there. During infections, I could only feed at 2/3 capacity. My son is now 11 months, and I haven't needed to supplement with formula since around week 10. Could not have done it without the pump.

It would also be nice to be able to program for milk increase, or decrease, for those women with painful oversupply. I had to cobble together information from all over the internet and various consultants to get up to adequate pump levels. Some women get infections because they have too much milk. Beyond convenience and nutrition, the pump is a medical tool that can help or hinder your body.
