It's about time for this hackathon!! Flanges work with gravity on cows because their udders point downwards. :-) Ours do not, please make a breast pump that does not require any kind of leaning forward. Oh, and while at it, if the flanges can be soft/silicon based and smaller instead of weird shaped cones which don't look anything like a baby's mouth, that would be fantastic! The suction of a baby to the breast is NOTHING like how the flange works!
