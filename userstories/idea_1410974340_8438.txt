more efficient (think hospital grade pump at a Medela price)

more sterile--the pump mechanism shouldn't have to be replaced due to health concerns 

fewer parts to lose

more momma/baby friendly: for mothers who need to pump while baby is latched on the other breast, most pumps are very clumsy and intrusive to the baby
