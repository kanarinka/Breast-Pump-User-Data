Love the work you're doing! Although I'll probably be past the need of a breast pump by the time something new comes to market, I thought I'd share my $0.02, even someone has probably already suggested it. 

I have no idea if it's possible, but creating something that feel less like my breast and nipple being yanked across the room and more like a nursing baby sure would have been nice. A sort of cup or sleeve that would mold and massage the breast to encourage let-down and more closely mimic actually nursing would be awesome and probably keep moms pumping longer. 

Many best wishes!
