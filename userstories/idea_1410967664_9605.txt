The current pumps tend to only use suction to express milk while the baby uses suction and pressure. In order to express enough milk while pumping, I am forced to do breast compressions the whole time (applying pressure to the base of the breast and moving towards the nipple. Are there new materials that would allow the pump flange to fit snugly over the nipple, more like the baby's mouth? The baby's tounge seems important as it applies pressure to the nipple and breast while the baby sucks, could the pump mimic that pressure? The baby takes the nipple and breast tissue way back into its mouth, so definitely get a picture of that and you'll see how different that is to air/suction based pumps. Also I use "pumpin pals" cones, which have a different shape and are more comfortable. 

Thanks! As a working mom and scientist, who currently spends about 1.5 hrs a day pumping, I can't wait to see what you come up with!!
