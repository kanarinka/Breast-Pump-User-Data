Hello!!!

It would be great if you didn't need the bottles attached to your boobs!! Thanks to bearing children they already take a beating, WHY on earth do we have to have weighted bottles pull on them any further?!  If you could design a silicone type device that straps over a good portion of the boob like a suction cup (instead of a plastic cone JUST on the nipple) that pulls the milk out, sends it down a tube that empties into a separate container (like a catheter works), life would be good.

:)

Hope this comes about soon!!!
