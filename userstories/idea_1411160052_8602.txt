Thank you so much for undertaking this project, it is long overdue and could be so beneficial families everywhere.  I am a full time working attorney with a 6 month old baby.  I have the extreme luxury of pumping in my own office behind a locked door with my own personal mini fridge in the office.  It is the best set-up possible for pumping - and I STILL HATE IT.  I have a few wish list type things for breast pumps that were not already listed from the Hackathon:

More flexible and longer tubing that runs from the pump to the flanges, and possibly opaque or even better, non-plastic/rubber tubes.  The current tubing is unwieldy, easily falls off, and is hard to clean - there much be a better material out there to act as a suction conduit.

If you are going to make a "smart" pump - one that records the time between let-downs and provides that data in an app to allow you to determine the most efficient optimal total pumping time for each session so you don't either turn it off right before another let down, or waste inefficient time pumping for 15 extra minutes for less than an ounce of milk.

I know it was mentioned, but adjustable sized flanges in a softer material would be SO wonderful.

To that end, a hands-free pumping bra or system that is more adjustable as you pump and actually fits with your pump to all for maximum suction and properly placed compression - including massaging actions around the breast to stimulate more milk output, not just the nipple areas.

Flanges that are somehow warm?

Bottom-weighted bottles that will not tip over easily.

A "quiet" or "pause" button so if you receive a call while working you can briefly pause the pump to take the call without having to dismantle everything or lose your setting, and then you can "unpause"
after the call.

Thank you again, and best of luck, I hope I will be able to find a new pump in the near future incorporating some of your great ideas.
