 I would like to be able to control the rythm - sometimes I feel like my Harmony goes too slow - but I should be careful for what I wish for because when I pump at home I am lucky enough to get to do it in our bedroom with the door closed while my husband watches the kids. If it pumped faster I would get less relaxation time with Netflix and a cup of tea!
