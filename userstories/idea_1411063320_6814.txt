I don't like that as I pump the milk goes into bottles hanging off my breasts making them heavier and heavier.  I have a Medela Pump in Style.  It would be great if the milk would go directly from my breast into a bag that isn't hanging off me getting filled with milk. Then I can just disconnect and throw the bag in the freezer.
