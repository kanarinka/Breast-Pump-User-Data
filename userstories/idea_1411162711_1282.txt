I have a Medela Pump in Style, so I will start with what I like;

The range of suction levels
The "letdown" cycle with the button to repeat it
The carrying bag

What I would change:

Soft flanges
Angled flanges
Single-piece flanges for easier cleaning
A setting to stop the letdown cycle once letdown has occurred
The carrying bag should have an insulated, machine washable cooler
liner and freezer packs.
It should have a hands-free option out of the box, you shouldn't have
to buy a $40 accessory to make it so.

Thank you for doing this! You are increasing health and wellness for
babies and mothers everywhere.
