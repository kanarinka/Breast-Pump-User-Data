I've used a few breast pumps. An ideal breast pump would it allow milk to enter the tubes (ameda), would not be painful, would stimulate the nipple to help increase milk production, and would be quiet and portable. The stimulation thing is huge. A nursing baby causes your milk to come in instantly, while these machines just don't have the same effect- possible due to the limited contact with the nipple. 
Kudos to you a if you can solve these issues!!
