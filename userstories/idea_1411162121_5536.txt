I love hearing that people are actually investing some time into this! It sounds amazing!!
I fall into a surprisingly large group of women that don't respond well to pumps. I honestly think that if the comfort could extend past just making one that isn't quite so hard and cold into one that can comfortably pull the milk out, many more women could use one.
I would suggest keeping the vacuum, but add in a breast shield that helps massage to encourage milk flow. I'm not innovative enough to come up with a design, but it has to be possible.
I'm sure there's an easier way to do it, but I picture either like little conveyor belts that roll down, or maybe something inflatable. The inflatable ones would have multiple chambers and something to make each chamber inflate individually from the outside in.
It sounds good in my head, I just don't have the resources to actually try and make it happen.
I (among many other moms I'm sure) appreciate anything and everything you all can do to make our lives a little easier. Thank you so much!!
