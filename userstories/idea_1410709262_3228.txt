Ugh, I asked for a medela pump in style (my co-worker had asked and received it so I had high hopes) but they sent an ameda purely yours which suuucked (except not really), so weak. I ended up using a hand me down medela from my cousin (which is not recommended) and that was better than the new ameda.
