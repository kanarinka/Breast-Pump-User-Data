I think it's wonderful that improvements for breastpump are being brainstormed at MIT. As a woman who has used 8 different breastpumps I know there's definitely room for improvement! Some suggestions:

-More customizable suction. I pump better with a hand pump bc I can more easily control the amount, speed & duration of the suction. 

-Some type of built in massage, vibration or compression. Milk expression output can be increased by 30% using massage & compression. 

-Quieter motors! 

-More comfortable flanges shaped in a way that utilizes gravity! 

-Adaptors that make pumping into a milk storage bag simple and easy. 

-Milk storage bags that accurately measure ounces of breastmilk!!! 

Good luck with the innovations!
