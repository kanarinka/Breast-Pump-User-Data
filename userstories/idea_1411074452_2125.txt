I would love to not have to take my shirt and bra off, just to put on a pumping bra and the huge bottles to catch the milk.. If there was a way that I could slip something small right up my shirt and fit Into my regular bra and then maybe have the milk go down small tubes and into bottles or bags connected to the machine itself.. So there are two tubes going to and from the pump and breast. One for suction and one for the milk. 

Desecrate pumping! 

Quite, some noise is okay. But I don't want someone to know what I'm doing.. 

And less parts and easy to clean!
