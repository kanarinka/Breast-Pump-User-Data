I've commented on my share of posts here - for sure - and with this topic fresh in my mind here I sit at my office desk pumping and thinking about it some more. I wear dresses a lot to work -- so, here I sit at my desk in a pair of spanx and hands free pumping bra. I really hope there isn't a fire alarm. I've just made myself power through being uncomfortable pumping at work and do it anyway because little Charlie needs it. I'm fortunate enough to have my own private office, but I think of my cousin's wife who is a teacher and has to use her locked classroom during recess. I would never wear anything but button down shirts. The Freemie looks good -- but I have rather large breasts that need a lot of support and thanks to Breakoutbras.com I have good bras - but there is no way that mamma-jamma of a Freemie is fitting in there. Something that could slip in my bra cup and drain by a small tube into a SINGLE collection container would be awesome.
