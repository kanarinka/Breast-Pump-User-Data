I forgot to add that the standard Medela flanges don't collect milk properly when I am reclined. I spent several weeks hunched over with an achey back before I purchased these: http://www.pumpinpal.com
Also, the friction on the flanges is very uncomfortable for a lot of women. Personally I have to lubricate mine with olive oil.
