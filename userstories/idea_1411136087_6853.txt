My background: New Mom (15 weeks!), pump-wrecker extrodinaire (5 malfunctioning pumps from 2 manufacturers my first 5 weeks of motherhood!), BSME- Michigan State University, American Society of Quality Certified Quality Engineer and Certified Quality Auditor.  These are the tips I have from my horrendous experience with pumping thus far.  

 quality control!!! I broke 5 pumps from 2 manufacturers my first month of motherhood. As a Mechanical and Quality Assurance Engineer and Auditor, these failure rates are unacceptable.

- standardize industry that if have a problem with your pump you shouldn't have to wait 7 business days for a replacement especially when pump has malfunctioned less than a week after purchase and is damaging breast tissue.  Placing a multiple hundred dollar hold on credit card to even start that 7 day shipping  process adds insult to injury as it remains for almost a month.

- make 24/7 help available.   Hard to call between the hours of 9a and 5p weekdays when are a working mom  

-Lubricant storage well/ warmer.  Warm olive oil to go! Cannot tell you how many times I forgot my oil.

- self contained.   Make it so flange, valves etc can clip to pump or make by hygiene kit transport case.  Zipper top disposable plastic bags only enhance the negative connotation idea what you're doing is dirty.

- change set up of hygiene kit. Multiple places are inaccessible for quick cleaning unless have running water and a brush.  Not ideal when on the go.

- add a condensate well in the tubing.  Suggest a short tube section from flange, plug into a condensate collector, then existing tubing can plug on the downstream side of condensate collector. 

- look into if a cam drive actuator for the cycle would be more effective than the current piston or bellows designs.  This would make it quieter, enhance durability, and ease of manufacture.

- a warmer so can get blocked ducts unplugged easier.

- headphone jack and volume control. Love the ability to record and playback your childâ€™s cry on the Hygeia pump, but with no volume control or headphone jack,  it cannot be used at work and is highly embrassing when it accidentally gets triggered.

- add a cover to the power switch for battery operated pumps to prevent accidental energization

- size, weight, portability.  I have to go a mile to my pumping room at work. I have a back injury sustained from a fall 10 days postpartum and these factors make my work life miserable.

- better instructions on pump settings for optimization

- make replacement hoses easier to purchase.   Why aren't they available at retail locations? I shouldn't have to go online. Many moms do not have access to such resources.

- separate suction ports for tubing with a cut off switch.  So can stop pumping just one side to change bottle, adjust flange, lubricate etc.  

- locking device for theft prevention and unauthorized usage so can leave pump in community pumping room at work.

- photo holder. I'd love to see my baby and remind me why I do this

- customizable.  Think cell phone "skins" but for breast pumps.

- clock/stopwatch/timer for recording length and time of pumping sessions and a place to record such info.

- battery charge level indicator. 

- dishwasher friendly hygiene kit. I've lost track of how many parts have fallen and melted.

- concealed milk storage for use of community fridge with risking offense (I was informed day 2 of returning to work that I was creating a hostile work environment by mentioning or in any way showing I'm a breast feeding mother.  This after I had to pump in my vehicle in 100 degree heat!)

- Organized storage/transport bag with contrasting interior or at minimum a contrasting trim on edge ofg pocket for easy of visualization and labled compartments.  Why the inside of these bags are black, have pockets that blend in and no way of organizing parts is beyond me.

P.S. Fellow colleague (husband of my IBCLC) and I started pump hacking on our own in June. He also turned in ideas!
