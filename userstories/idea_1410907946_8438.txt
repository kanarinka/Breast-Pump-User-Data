Will you incorporate a flange that provides an angle more similar to the angle the baby latches from than the standard flange?  I have yet to try this one from Pumpin' Pal, but have heard good things about this kind of flange from friends struggling with painful nipples while pumping: http://www.pumpinpal.com.
