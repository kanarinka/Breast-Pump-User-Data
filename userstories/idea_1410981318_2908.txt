Cleaning and parts - I hate all the little parts. It takes so long to set up to pump, and I already feel bad about taking time from work to pump. Also, it all takes so long to clean. I feel like I'm not cleaning it well enough or often enough, but I do what I can.
More efficient - babies get so much more out of boobs than pumps, and I wish that wasn't the case.
Size - I hate lugging it to and from work, but I'm not going to spend my money on a second one.
Noise - It's so loud. People in the next office over can hear it, which is a little embarrassing.
