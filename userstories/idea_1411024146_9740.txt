Hi,

Some ideas:
Eliminate the need to lean forward during pumping
Eliminate the need to use a bra to hold the cups, I.e. create better suction for any type of breast
Less parts to clean
Output goes directly into bpa free freezable storage bag
Maybe cups can be made of silicone or a similar bendable  material to facilitate heat transfer during a breast massage to get the milk flowing and maybe make it easier for women to constantly wear the pump through out the day and only switch itut on when they feel the milk is flowing,  eliminating the need for breast pads
