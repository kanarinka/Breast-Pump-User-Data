I would love a breast pump that doesn't require 80 million tiny little parts which can be lost or dirtied daily. One that doesn't make that horrible milking noise that reminds me of the dairy barn at the state fair. I would also love a pump with shields that either don't require a fancy bra/gadget to hold them up. If we could have one with shields that collapse (like flexible silicone) for more discrete, easier travel, that would be awesome, too. Thanks, MIT!!
