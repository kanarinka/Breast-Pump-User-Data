I breastfed 2 tiny humans until they were each 1. I am a school teacher who has never had a lunch period or  a break in the day based on the nature of the kids I teach. So I pumped in the athletic "closet" (it is only a 3/4) in my classroom while my class worked on activities. I also am a coach, so pumped on buses to away meets, in locker rooms of other schools, in my car, and anywhere else. But it was worth all of it. Here is what I would have loved. A backpack pump - it was so hard to carry my pump everywhere along with the other things I used. A built in way to go hands free - I am not going to lie, I did a lot of things while pumping, many of them awkward because I only had use of one arm while the other held the pump in place. Plus I often fed on one side, while pumping on the other side, so a built in device to the pump would have been awesome. I didn't always have the magic bra on that would allow me to pump hands free. And noise - if you could make them quieter, more would be right with the world. I know that all of these have been hit on and I want to say thank-you! With people like you, breastfeeding will become the norm and no one will think twice when they see a woman pumping or breastfeeding. I wouldn't trade a second of it, but am glad that I am done. So thank-you for being awesome!
