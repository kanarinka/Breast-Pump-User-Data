The suckiest part of the breast pump, for me, was the "flange". It's shape makes it very awkward.  It sticks 
out very far and fits awkwardly underneath clothing. For moms who pump a lot it's not uncommon to have to pump sometimes in public or on the go. A  awkward flange would make this suck lea. Also, a flange with better suction, a more hands free friendly model (for when multi tasking is a neces
sity), and a more leak proof suction. It sucks when you are pumping and have to bend over to tend to your fussy baby (who won't breast feed) and spill milk all over yourself in the process.
