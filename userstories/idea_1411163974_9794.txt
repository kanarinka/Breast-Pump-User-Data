I agree being able to lie down and pump would be a huge help to exhausted mothers. Perhaps this could be made possible by designing a sports bra that would have the pumping connections and bags (not bottles) for milk to collect in it?  The connections to the breast could be made of a rubber material that would suction onto the breast (instead of hard, unbendable plastic sheilds). The pump motor should be designed to last longer and be more poweful when running on battery. And should also be quieter. Compact, and easy to transport is also key!
