I am a working mom and i currently own a pumping-n-style, the following are ideas that would help as my pump could use a Fashionable/useful upgrade:

1. Fashionable style/ including color
2. Stainless free
3. Use it as a purse(keep iphone or wallet or keeping treats since you get so hungry after) (avoid carrying to much at the same time)
4. Variety of handle of pump(i.e shoulder carrier, hand held)
4. avoid having to many parts
5. make it easier to clean
6. making parts more dureable
