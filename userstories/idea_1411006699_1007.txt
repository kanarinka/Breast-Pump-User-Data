Make it smaller!!  How can an iPhone fit all that amazing technology in the palm of our hands, yet us moms are still lugging a giant bag (along with everything else!) to work every day?  

Also, there must be a better way to have it stay on so we can be hands-free than a bra with holes.  Sitting down and holding a pump for 20 min multiple times/day is not an efficient use of time.

Please help us!!  Breastpumps are so outdated and cumbersome!!
