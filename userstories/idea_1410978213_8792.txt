Here is my wish list of improvements:
1.  Be able to move without spillage.  Bending over to put a pacifier in a baby's mouth without spilling would be great.  I can go 'wireless' with battery power and a 'hands-free' bra, but I still can't do much of anything while I pump.
2.  Not get milk EVERYWHERE when I take of the cups.  I always have a tissue ready to catch it.
3.  Get perfect nipple placement.  "Rug burn" on the nips = not good.  Nipples rubbing against the sides when you didn't get it right in the middle in the dark at 3 a.m. just sucks.
4.  Um, does the whole world need to know what I'm doing??  No.  Make these things quieter!  (Not to mention it not waking my baby that I have placed nearby because I can't move (see #1) when I am alone.
5. Easier to clean.  I can't get in all the crevices that milk does in the pieces and parts.
