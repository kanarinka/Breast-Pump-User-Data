A breast pump that doesn't spill milk back on your breasts if you lean back would be awesome. Also, cleaning parts between pumps is such a time suck and pain. 
Also for new moms, it would be helpful if there were clearer markings on the flange so you could see where your nipple should be for best placement.
I also wonder if flanges could be made out of a more flexible material that better matched the shape of nipples and breasts
