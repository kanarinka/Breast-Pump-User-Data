I do not know what makes the Medela hospital-grade pump's suction so effective and quiet, but it is very expensive. I have used the Medela freestyle, which is about the best you could do for portability, but it is no match for the hospital-grade pump.  Is there a way to get the same suction and quietness in a less expensive, handheld (or clippable) device?
