I have three pumps, all Ameda brand and I do like the closed loop system bc it helps me feel secure that the system stays clean. I have two Purely Yours, one at work and one for travel, and the hospital grade Platinum at home that I'm renting bc I'm having milk supply issues. (After 3x mastitis and going back to work my supply plummeted). The hospital grade is by far the most efficient but it. is. so. Heavy. Would never attempt to travel on the commrail with this thing. Is it too out of the box to imagine a travel pump system that has a docking station of some kind that could give you the boost of a hospital grade?
