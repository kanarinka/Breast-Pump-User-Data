It needs to function and allow you to sleep at the same time. It would benefit from a timer so that you can nap (haha with a newborn) and it would shut itself off and possibly built into clothing (i.e. bra). 
It needs to be quieter. 
If it could keep track of how much you've pumped that day/week/month that would be awesome. 
If it could have a mini battery pack attached to the flange/bottle combo, so that you could where it while doing dishes, laundry, running after kids...

I was an exclusive pumper for 12 months, this hackathon is amazing. Thank you.
