It's been a couple of years since I was pumping at work, but I wanted to share some user experiences to inform your work.

To make sure I wouldn't run out of milk for my baby, I pumped a small stash of backup milk to have on hand before I went back to work--about 40oz--which I kept in my freezer in specially produced breastmilk storage bags. Once I got back to work, I aimed to pump as much milk as would be needed for my baby for the next day, but of course, supply varies by day. Some days I'd be ahead, and some days I'd be behind--so I'd either draw from the freezer or add to it.

Because frozen milk has a limited lifetime, and in order to draw older milk out of the freezer stash and replace it with newer milk, I used a Monday/Friday system (not my invention; I know lots of women who do this). On Monday morning, baby got the oldest milk from the freezer. On Tuesday, he got the fresh milk pumped Monday; on Wednesday, he got Tuesday's milk; and so on through Friday. Friday's milk went into the freezer to replenish the stash. 

For days that I was intending to pump to freeze, I wanted to pump directly into freezer bags, bypassing the bottle (and saving a round of bottle-washing). But, although all the brands of freezer bags that I tried have ounce measurements marked on the side, none have flat bottoms. The measurements aren't accurate. 

A bag that measured the milk accurately? A small thing. But would contribute to slightly less suckage.
