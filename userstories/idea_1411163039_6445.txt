1. Flange that mimics babies 'taco rolled' tongue with ability to compress at base towards nipple- basically mimicking babies suckle. A softer material- like silicon etc. Think of the 'pocket pussy' lol sorry that's only product comes close...
2. I hate the huge pack I carry around, hate washing before and after, hate attaching tubes, etc less parts to lug around.
3. Bags that screw on, and don't leak instead of attachments that loosely hold a bag on
4. A video of my baby suckling, earphones attached.
