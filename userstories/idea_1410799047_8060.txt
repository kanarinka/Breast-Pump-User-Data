Flexible nipple shields/flanges, larger flange sizes for smaller nipples. Ex: I have tiny nipples, huge boobs, so my nipples get the best fit in medela's small, but I can't use them because they don't even cover my areola, it's nonsense. I'm stuck using larger sizes and not getting as much milk as I could probably with a better engineered flange.
