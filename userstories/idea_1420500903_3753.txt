Wow, a mom friend told me about this and it is even greater than I expected. I am attorney who almost exclusively pumped for 7 -10 months each of my 2 kids. I put a couple ideas I have below. I practice corporate transactional law in NYC, if there is any way I can be of assistance please call me anytime. Rachel Haber 646-234-3696.

Idea: Make the flange not hard and not out of plastic/plastic-y surface. The only part that really needs to be hard is the part at the base of the nipple (and even then, it would be great if it were a softer plastic that you could squeeze). If the part that hugs the breast were soft and did not have plastic-y surface, it would cause less irritation to the skin of the breast and you could pump more efficiently because you can help manually (as is, with the plastic flange, when you help manually you are only able to touch the upper parts of the breast). Also, i always used to get milk in that upper part of the flange and would have to take it off to try it mid-pumping in order not to cause a rash and to allow it to work properly.

Idea: if the flange does have to be hard, perhaps improve the shape with a sort of bell curve so it stimulates the breast in several places.

Idea: lets find a different name than "flange" for that part

Idea: Please make the pump digital. I saw that one of the winning ideas did this. I can't emphasize enough how great it would have been to be able to set the pump on a precise scale, to measure some vitals, and to keep track of when i pumped, for how long, and even have a scale to weigh the milk or ability to record how much I pumped.

Good luck! And please don't hesitate to take me up on my offer, I would love to be involved somehow.
