Make it comfortable to use the double pump and easier to hold.  The medela pump in style connectors are made for both the electric pump and a hand held so when I use the electric pump and have to hold both bottles while pumping (I don't have a hands free bra) I get these big circle impressions on my arms from where I hold the bottles.  Sometimes if I am not paying attention one of the tubes gets crimped and milk starts to back up into the tubes.  You shouldn't have to get a special bra to use your double pump!
