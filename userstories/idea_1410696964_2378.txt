YES. I remember thinking that I would pay pretty much any amount of money for a pump that could somehow work while I was asleep... My firstborn nursed happily all night and I rarely woke up--why can't a pump do that?! I say this somewhat tongue-in-cheek, but it sure is aspirational. Why not aim for the stars, yes?
