Can the material that touches the mothers skin be printed with a fun and trendy pattern? This may make it feel less medicalized. Although I agree with Olivia Edwards, the less chemicals, the better. The last time I pumped, I gave my freshly pumped milk to my older daughter. She didn't like the taste of it. I assumed it had picked up the taste of plastic, having gone through the flanges, tubing and then to a plastic bottle.
The pattern, I think would still have to be somewhat see through, so the mother who is pumping can see her let downs and gauge when to stop pumping or work out what pumping routine helps with let downs.
