When my son was born I wanted to breastfeed because of all the benefits that I and my child would recieve. Unfortunately I was unable to breastfeed my son and I reluctantly turned to formula, within minutes of my son receiving formula his eyes swelled shut and hives surfaced all over his body. I instantly started panicking,  turns out my son is severely allergic to formula. So, the only option I had was to pump. I was pumping 8-12 times a day for a half an hour when my son was first born. I was not getting any sleep since I was a single mother, having a newborn, and between pumping. I finally understood the saying crying over spilled milk because I was so exhausted that I would fall asleep pumping and with the current breast pumps on the market they don't allow you to lie down or sit comfortably. I also suffered from constant mastitis and infections from exclusively pumping because the pump is not the same as breastfeeding a child. Pumping at work was a hassle and never really felt like a real break.
