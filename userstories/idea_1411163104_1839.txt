Can you please also figure out how to make them reusable/sanitary to pass on to other mothers? I know of only And recyclable when they are finally done? They are such a waste!

Technically most brands have to be thrown out as they theoretically could allow some fluid in the motor……even though I doubt this happens often.

And there is no where to recycle them when they finally do end their life.

It feels like such a waste of money and landscape space.
 
And for your next project could you please tackle recycling used car and booster seats?

Thank you so much!
