I don't have any ideas,  but a list of complaints/challenges of breast pumps

1. Should be hands free-  and not in a creepy bra type milk cow way that makes you feel like you are a resident at a dairy farm.   It never fails when I sat down to pump for my baby, my toddler would march over and start climbing on me or pulling at the tubes or just generally getting into trouble.

2. Too many parts to clean.  Few women have good support to pump at work,  and when we do,  it takes longer to clean the parts than to pump sometimes.  And a total PITA in the middle of the night!

3. The whole thing is huge

4. Commercially available ones aren't very strong-- leading to a decrease in supply at least for me!

Thanks!  Such a great idea to reimagine this. And so many babies will love you for it!
