On behalf of anyone who has tried to pump for their second (or later) child... please can we have toddler-proof buttons (or no visible buttons at all)? The buttons on mine are large, very visible, and light up when pressed, making them pretty much irresistible to my toddler. My phone has a lock on it. Why can't my breast pump?
