Beyond the obvious (we really need something easy to clean, easy to assemble, quiet and wireless), it would be important to be able to use it comfortably under a shirt if possible, with it's own sensor to trigger a let down once milk has stopped flowing. That way mom doesn't have to keep an eye on the amount already pumped and turn on the let down suction rate again. This would allow mothers to pump in a variety of settings. Also, pouring from whatever has accumulated the milk into bottles easily is important. Thank you so much for doing this! It has the potential to make a big difference in maternal and infant health.
