Hi -- I'm sure someome brilliant on your team has already thought of my ideas, but:
1.. Can the amounts be digitally recorded and reviewed? i.e. L pumped 3oz this time, 6oz today total. And maybe I can scroll back to see how much it did yesterday and the day before. 
2.. An optional alarm reminder. Women with a good supply need only their breasts to remind them to pump, but others of us who are pumping to help increase supply could use a reminder for every X amount of hours
3.. My previous 2 ideas would really prosper with a correlating smart phone app 
4.. There is a "letdown" button on most breast pumps, so you can let it know when to switch modes. This happening automatically with sensors works be pretty cool 
5... The design of the (I don't know what their called), "boob funnels," (sorry, where the milk goes in) -- could use some work. Instead of so rigid, perhaps softer (silicone-y?). Maybe softer and more mobile so that you needn't worry what "size" you are
6.. It would be nice to be able to pump directly into storage bags/containers 

Ok, I think that's all I got. Thanks for listening. And thanks (really thanks) for even doing this.
