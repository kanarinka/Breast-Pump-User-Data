I liked the example! As a lactation consultant and former nursing mom I hear the concerns of new moms. Pumping convenience is a largely expressed concern among moms. I also would like to see a pump that could be in a fanny pack. I would also like to see a pump that could have  "recordable sounds" via an ear piece or ear bud for mom, with the cooing sounds of her baby. Just like in a grrocery store or other place a nursing mom may lactate when sounds of a baby are heard. Maybe this would stimulate production of milk if her babys sounds were available during pumping. Thank you for the opportunity to contribute an idea. Good luck and thank you for your work to help breastfeeding moms!!
