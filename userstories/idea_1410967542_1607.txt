For women with limited milk supply, every drop counts:

Spill-safe collection kits. With kids and pets running around a house, items can get knocked over. 

Efficient collection kits that ensure that as little milk as possible gets left in the breast shields and collection pieces, i.e. as much milk straight to the bottle/collection bag as possible!
