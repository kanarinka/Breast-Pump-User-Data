It's a blessing and a curse. I was a 38JJ pre - pregnancy, so there is just a ton of storage space. I only get that much in the mornings if she hasn't gotten up overnight to eat. I have a hands free bra, but it just doesn't work that well. It kind of restricts my milk flow bc it basically squishes them and doesn't provide support at the same time. Couple that with 2 8oz bottles... let's just say I'm being for a better style of pump.
