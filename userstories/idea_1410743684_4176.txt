I hate the way I feel when I pump. I will nurse in public without batting an eye but I am even embarrassed to pump in front of my husband and would never consider pumping in front of anyone else. (Unfortunately my husband is too hard to avoid!) I don't understand how other women manage to pump in their cars.

This may seem like a secondary issue, but when you hate something that you have to do multiple times per day -- especially when you are already physically and emotionally drained -- it really starts to wear you down.
