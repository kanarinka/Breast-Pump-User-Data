here are some ideas for the hackathon. thank you so much for working on this tremendously important project!
the entire suction area and mechanism needs to be redesigned to mimic an actual baby nursing and not a cold plastic air vacuum. for example:

the baby nurses through a combination of compression and suction, not just suction alone. gentle compression should be a simultaneous function.

also, very often, women need to use breast compression and massage while pumping. could a pump have a pliable material that encompasses the entire breast for optional massage/compression?

the feeling of cold air pulling on breast tissue is not pleasant and not at all like the feeling of nursing. could the air be warmed? could the seal be better and softer?

could the entire pump be wearable, sort of like a baby in a sling? 

bottles or receptacles should be very light or there should be a way to harness them to the body; even wearing a hands-free bra, you can be "weighed down" by the bottles as they fill up and need to use both hands to hold them up.

better hands-free bras and camisoles that work more like nursing bras so that you can wear them all day and quickly convert them for pumping. (so you don't have to strip down to put on your bra to pump.)
i hope this helps your work. so glad some top brains are on this, and can't wait to see the outcome!
