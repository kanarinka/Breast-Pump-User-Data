Hi,

I am a new mom and I had twins in June who are still in the ICU at MGH. I also just finished my third year of surgical residency at the Lahey Clinic in Burlington and am very interested in device innovation. I have been thinking of ways to improve the breast pump since I started needing it after my babies were born. I know registration is full but if anyone drops out, I would love to enter the competition. 

Thanks so much,
