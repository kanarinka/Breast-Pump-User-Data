There are small holes on the Medela connectors on the side the tubing connects. I suspect it is to help with air pressure for the suction; however, if the bottle is knocked over or tips, the milk will spill out of the little holes.  Can we figure out a way to minimize the amount spilled or do away with the little holes?
