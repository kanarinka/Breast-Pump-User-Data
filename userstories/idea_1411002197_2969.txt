What we need: smaller, quieter pumps. They need to have fewer parts and be easier to clean and keep sanitary. The freemies have the right idea, where you can place the collection cups in your bra but they have suction issues and milk backs up into the tubes. Regular flanges force you to bend forward so the milk flows into the cups. Super annoying! Also, most pumping moms need freedom to move around and pick up a screaming baby.
