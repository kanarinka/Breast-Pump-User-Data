FYI I was just brainstorming with Andrew Whitacre about using high-tech materials for knitting pump cozies which could then help dampen/reduce the motor's sound. Nancy Tessel Holtzman's recommended technique is to wrap a towel around the pump to dampen the noise - maybe the pump cozy could be a handy alternative to that?
