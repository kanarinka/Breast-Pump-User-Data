Just as a place to start, the manual Medela Harmony breast pump is by far the most comfortable and most similar to actually breastfeeding I have ever used (and I've used about 4-5 different ones). Has to do with the way the nipple is pulled in - speed, distance traveled, pressure, I don't know what. Starts off gentle and doesn't just rip your boob into the mechanism. Take a look at it.
