I exclusively pumped for a year because my daughter had a partial cleft in the soft palate. I used a hospital grade pump, which is a beast. More power in less size without need for a plug.  Truly portable hospital grade without loss of suck power.  Also, flanges. Medela's are no good (they suck, but not in the right way!).  I got "after market" flanges that were great, but expensive and I had to hunt for them.  A flange will never be a substitute for a baby's mouth, but it could be a closer estimation,  I'm sure.
