 My insurance paid for the Medela Pump In Style. I like that it looks like a little backpack and that it has space for your cooler, etc. The pump itself is still loud and the tubes seem to always get condensation in them. 

Had an Ameda with my first daughter. The pumps are more or less the same in terms of operation.
