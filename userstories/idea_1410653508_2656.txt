I am a breast surgeon who has been involved in studies looking at nipple discharge.  The key to obtaining fluid from the nipple - and that it what nursing is on a large scale - is to massage and compress the breast gently before applying suction. Essentially massage the fluid toward the nipple rather than trying to suction it out. The natural process of nursing is based on milk letdown into the area behind the nipple where the baby rolls its tongue under this area, more to massage milk out than to pull it out by suction.  The key would seem to be to duplicate this action.  Perhaps a ring shaped pillow or cone that inflated in rhythm to massage the breast and then allowed much less suction to remove milk.  Great challenge you have given yourselves.
