If I could hook myself up to my breastpump at night, and go to sleep knowing that my pump would switch on, extract milk, and refrigerate it, I would be one well-rested mommy! As it is, I have to keep setting my alarm to wake up and pump. My babies sleep through the night, but I'm losing so much sleep just pumping!
