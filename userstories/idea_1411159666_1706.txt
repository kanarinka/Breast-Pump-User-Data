This was the most TIMELY article anyone has ever sent to me.  A friend of mine emailed me your article on this project as a sit in a cold, shower room in the basement of my work building.  (With my lap-top on the sink-counter, typing away).  Yes, I am pumping...right.now. And I am determined to get to 12 months. (28 days to go!)  My ideas are as follows:
1. suctions need to closer mimic my babys mouth, OUCH pumps are NOT cozy, breastfeeding is (or can be)
2. Why is it SO loud?  I think everyone can here me, I used to care... I know exit the shower room with indifference
3. I wish both boobs could funnel into one bottle - I have to dirty two every time - and I never make THAT much milk
This is fun - have so much fun!
