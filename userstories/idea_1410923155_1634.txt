Make it possible for a breast pump to be 'handed down' from one mom to the next. They are expensive (though hurray - as of February 2011, the IRS ruled that the cost of breast pumps, and related equipment, will now be considered as tax-deductible medical expenses.  This new ruling means that pre-tax funds from flexible spending accounts (FSA) and health reimbursement arrangements (HRA) can be used for the purchase of these supplies.) -- and usually only 'hospital grade' breast pumps would be usable by multiple women without health risks.
