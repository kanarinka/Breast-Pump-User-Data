 have exclusively pumped for all 3 of my children. I started when my 6 year old was born and now I am EPing for my 6 month old. I think the material is a challenge- it would be nice if the flanges could be made of a silicone-based material so they are more comfortable and not so pokey. Also the spilling is an issue when I need to bend forward to pick something up. A device that is smaller, quieter, more portable, but with same suction as a top-grade medela. So happy you have taken up this issue! Pumps are fantastic but could stand some solid improvements!
