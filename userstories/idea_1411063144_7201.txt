From a coworker who is notorious for pumping while driving.


I think there are a few obvious ones- a place to pump at work, time at work to pump, yadda, yadda, but about the machinery itself I would offer:

-There were always a lot of pieces and parts to clean and remember. There were often days where I got to work and was like- damn!- I forgot this piece. It would be great if all the pieces and parts were inside of one contraption so you would not forget them. 

-If there was a way (I know this from pumping while driving) that when you unscrew the pumper from the actual bottle there was a back flow preventer like piece or part so that between the moment you unscrew the machine and you locate and screw the lid on, you do not spill and lose any of the milk. It is particularly unattractive to spill the milk down the front of you on the way to work and describe what it is and why it is there.
