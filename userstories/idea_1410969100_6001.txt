Silicone flanges (or some flexible material) to create a better seal and not let your nipple get pulled to one side!

Better seals where the bottles screws on to the pumping attachment so that a full bottle won't leak if it's slightly tilted to the side!

Get rid of those little "membranes" they are SO TINY get lost, easily break and go down the drain!
