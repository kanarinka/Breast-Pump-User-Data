Thank you for tackling this issue! I often left for work in a sleep deprived haze unknowingly leaving some crucial gasket or flange at home by mistake. I would love a pump that identifies missing crucial components before I walk out the door. I think of my grandpa's peg board with outlined tools. Make it obvious if a vital operational part is missing. The frustration of rushing to the oversubscribed lactation room only to be foiled by the pump was gut-wrenching. Second, a fun feature would be a running total of your ounces or time pumped. It could be community-building for new Moms with an app similar to FitBit. New methods to provide encouragement to each other during this phase of life are needed.
