my insurance only covered the hygeia Q pump which is the lowest of their pumps, not super effective, didn't come with a bag that I could use at work, good 1 yr warranty as mine broke 2 wks in and they shipped me a new one asap, I offered to pay the difference to upgrade to the enjoy( which is awesome! hygeia is awesome…hands down) and they wouldn't let me. the Q pump doesn't stimulate let down very well and the suction needs to be stronger…but it was free…so yay?
