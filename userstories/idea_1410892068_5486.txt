I am a working nursing mom on my second baby.  I pumped for both kids and have used these different brands: Medela, Simplisse, Ameda  I currently just pump by hand at the moment.  I find it faster than putting together and cleaning all the parts.  These are some of the features that I think would be cool to have in a breast pump:  Quiet.  Not hurting.  adjustable/multiple sizes of attachments and collection bottles.  Double or single options.  sturdy parts that don't break/get lost. simple to put together. hands free.  portable.  small so you can wear it under clothing discreetly. easy to clean (without access to water if possible). battery, plug or manual options.  parts you can refrigerate that don't topple over (I stick the assembled parts in the fridge between pumpings so I don't have to clean them as often).  adjustable speeds/suction. locking mechanism so your older kids don't come along and push the buttons while you are using it.  Collects data on how much/often/long you pump.  A screen that displays your data or plays relaxing music or plays TV/movies or displays pics of your babies.  I am sure Ill think of other ideas but that is what I have for now.  THANK YOU for doing this.  Breast pumps are not very fun and I am sure you can do a better job than what is currently out there!
Good Luck.
