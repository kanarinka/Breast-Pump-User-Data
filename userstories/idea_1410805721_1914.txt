A pump that's more self-contained. On more than one occasion, I got to work and realized I'd forgotten to pack the flanges or bottles or tubes. So many parts to clean and remember! And the setup and takedown (flanges, tubes, a disconnected power source, bottles) just added to the time away from my work. Ugh.
