Breastpumps would be better if: 

If the parts didn't have to come apart to wash- I waste so much time gathering 5 different parts (times 2) everyday.

If the cap to the bottles didn't acquire food bits from flipping over in the dish washer.

If they didn't drip milk all over everything during use.

Thanks!
