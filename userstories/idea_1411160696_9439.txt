If you could make a breast pump that was easier to clean and didn't have so many parts, that would be a huge help. 

Also, and I realize this would be hard, but if you could make one that you could wear while moving around, that would be HUGE. I had twins and it was hard for me to stay tethered to a pump when there was always laundry/dishes or a baby crying.
