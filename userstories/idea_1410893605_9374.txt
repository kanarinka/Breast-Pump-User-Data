Collection tubes made of a material that is soft enough that it can be flipped inside out for cleaning.

A lot of comments have been that they would like milk to flow down tubes to a collection bottle/bag. I imagine the problem with that is being able to thoroughly clean the tubes. If they are thin, like the suction tubes on a Madela (which don't come into contact with milk!) they would be very difficult to clean. If they are bigger, then you lose ease and discretion.  Collection tubes made of a material that is soft enough that it can be flipped inside out for cleaning, might work?
