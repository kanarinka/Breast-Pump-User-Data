I use a Medela Pump In Style. After using it for the past three and a half months, my suggestions for breast pump improvement are as follows: 
1) Breast pumps should have a clock and timer on them somewhere. A lot of us moms are pressed for time and/or hate pumping so much that we have to make ourselves pump for a certain increment of time. When pumping, I usually set a timer for 15 minutes on my cell phone. Rather than scrambling for a phone or looking at a clock/watch and struggling to remember when I started pumping, it would be helpful if this feature was included on the pump. 
2) Traveling with a pump is terrible. Is there a way for the carrying case to also include space for parts (bottles, bags, flanges, etc.)? I end up tossing all of the various parts into a ziplock bag and then toss this, along with my pumping bra, the pump, and tubes into a separate small duffel. When it's all put together for travel, it's bulky and awkward. 
3) The incessant chant of the pump is enough to drive sleep-deprived moms crazy. For those trying to be discrete, the pumping sound is a dead giveaway for what's going down. Is there a way to make these things quieter? 
4) Dials deserve numbers and an arrow. I have a dial on my pump that is marked by dots and the dial knob has no arrow. I have no idea of the "level" at which I usually pump. (Just look at the dial on the In Style. What the heck?) So, when I turn the knob, I am guessing at which "strength" my little friend is working.
5) For some moms, a mechanism that allows them to keep track of when they pumped, which breast(s) they pumped, and how much they pumped would come in handy. There are apps for this, but it would be nice for all of the pumping experience to be more streamlined.  
6) I have no idea of how this could be improved: Cleaning pump parts is a pain in the butt. 

Three cheers for MIT! Thank you!
