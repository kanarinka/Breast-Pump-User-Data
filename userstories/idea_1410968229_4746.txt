The ability for the pump shield to massage the breast (to help extract more milk quicker and more efficiently). 

Some sort of massager, or sift feel like material in the breast shield where the nipple gets sucked to be more like a babies mouth.

The ability to pump while reclined or even better yet, laying down. Being a mom (or dad ) is exhausting. But trying to provide what is best for baby is even more tiring. The ability to relax/sleep and pump would be greatly appreciated.
