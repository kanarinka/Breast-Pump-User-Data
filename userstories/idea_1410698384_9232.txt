about the importance of adjustability. The system needs to be flexible for the different production levels. As we see in the comments, some momma's can produce great volumes, 16oz at a time (you rock!). I on the other hand have always struggled to pull out a meal, like 6-7oz. So, comfort at all capacities. Especially for new mommas (often high stress NICU mommas) who are only pulling 1oz. in the beginning, the pump experience needs to be as supportive as possible.
