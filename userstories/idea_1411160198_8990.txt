I have to say I was a little disappointed with the article. When I saw the title I thought "At last, someone is going to redesign the breast pump to make it more like actual breastfeeding", but all of the ideas seemed to accept the basic design and just add to it.

The biggest problem with breast pumps is that they don't extract milk the way a baby does. That is why they are so much less efficient. Your aim should be to create a pump that matches the milk-extracting ability of a baby. As a breastfeeding I spend my time helping mothers to ensure that their baby is well latched on. We explain that there should be an asymmetrical latch with more areola showing at the top than the bottom and with baby taking a large mouthful of breast. When we have babies who have tongue ties we explain to the mothers that the problem is that the baby extracts the milk using a rhythmic motion with their tongue and that if it can't extend fully then it won't milk the breast efficiently. So a pump should do this too. The suction should not extract the milk - it should be just enough to create a seal (as the baby does). Then a moving part of some sort is needed to mimic the action of the tongue on the breast. To encourage a letdown the artificial tongue should also be warm and possibly moist as well as soft (perhaps made of silicone). 

Everything else, like a quieter motor, is just window dressing. The pump design needs to be radically changed so that a pump becomes as efficient as a breastfeeding baby by working with the normal physiology of human lactation.

I'll be watching your progress with interest.
