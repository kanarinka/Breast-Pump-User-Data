Please have them make less noise.

Maybe someone could build an attachment so they could hold your phone (like the ones that attach in the car to the vent or have a slot to hold an iphone like an ipod doc slot that secures the phone - maybe even sync it to the pump mechanics for measuring/timing/recording pump stats, etc., an app?) - hands free x's three.  It would be nice to read mom support group posts, emails, look at pictures of your baby while pumping, with less juggling of the jugs :)
