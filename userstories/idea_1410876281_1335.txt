Make a better hand pump that is easy to use... I like to use a hand pump in the mornings when I had oversupply (read stocked the freezer!) because it was easier than connecting the electric pump.  The problem with the hand pump was that part you pumped with your hand was hard connected to the shield so it was easy to move it and lose suction...
