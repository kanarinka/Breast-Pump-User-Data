Hi, 
I recently came across the article "The Media Lab 'Make the Breast Pump Not Suck' Hackathon" and I think this is such an awesome idea. I've been pumping at work the last 10.5 months and I think you've got some great ideas. I would like to add that it would be nice if hooking up the pump to myself to be hands-free didn't practically require a clothing change. I'm not sure how it would work but if there was a way to almost suction or stick it on - or something - so I didn't have to put on a different bra, etc, it would cut time out of a pump session which would make it so much easier!
I love what you guys are coming up with and can only hope some of this will be an option by the time the next baby comes around. 
Thanks!
