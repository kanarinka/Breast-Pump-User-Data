More comfortable phlanges (silicone?) that can be placed inside a regular bra, worn for long periods (work day?) and connect to tubing rather than dangling bottles. Milk flows through tubing, regardless of my body position (I don't have to hunch forward!) to collection system (like a col bag or camelback?). Auto program able pump. Silent pump. Able to record and play sounds of my baby and a headphone jack. Better battery life (rechargable?)
