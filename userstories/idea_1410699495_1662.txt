I am loving the idea of soft moldable silicone flanges that are warmed by your body temperature and could possibly be worn under a shirt. There are intimate toys with this material on the market now.
Motors are smaller and quieter why is the breast pump so loud. It is tough to pump at work and then to have a loud motor and cold plastic flanges...well it gets arduous.
A wearable or compact quiet hook up device would be an improvement.
