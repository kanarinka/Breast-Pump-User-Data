A pump that could be used while laying down/sleeping. Working full time on second shift my kids learn to sleep sleep through the night early. If I could pump at night where it could be set to timed intervals, without overfilling, I would be able to get all the sleep I need, have enough milk for when I'm at work, and maybe not get my menstruation cycle back so early.
