Moldable breast pump phalanges

Moms with breast and nipples that don't fit the standard sizes should have the possibility of a technician molding her breasts to make pump parts especially for her. : ) Or maybe the pump parts should be made out of a similar plastic to mouth guards. Mom can choose the right closest size, attach the nipple part of the phalange to the breast part, heat and mold. 

As a pediatrician and IBCLC, this would have been great for a mom with small breasts with large nipples.  All the different phalanges left bruises : ( 

Good luck!!
