Hi!!

I wanted to reach out to introduce myself. I was so excited to see your hackathon!!  We absolutely need better options for women who are breast feeding.

Here is my idea:  I had a prophylactic bilateral mastectomy in 2012, before having children.  One of the things that I had to grieve was the loss of my ability to breastfeed my children.  For women who cannot breastfeed due to having a bilateral mastectomy, or for women who have difficulties breastfeeding for various reasons, I would love to see a device that facilitates breast feeding.  My dream would be to have both a device and connection to a local network of new mothers who could help donate milk.
