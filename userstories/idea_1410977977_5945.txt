A way to pump discretely. A pump where most of the apparatus could remain under your clothing (maybe pump into bags?) so we don't have to completely undress. This would help A LOT of working women.
A pump that would allow the user to lean back. Pumping is really uncomfortable, especially on the lower back.
Smaller, less noisy, and less costly pumps
Less "medical looking".
Thank you MIT for looking at this! I have sons.... But I hope my daughters-in-law will benefit from this technology.
