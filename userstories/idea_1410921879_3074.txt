If you haven't watched Stanford's video on using your hands while you pump watch it! http://newborns.stanford.edu/Breastfeeding/MaxProduction.html

This video has completely changed my out put and comfort while pumping. My biggest stresses as a working mom are getting the time and space to pump during my day, then how much I'm getting. My daughter consumes 16 ounces while I'm at work on a good day I get 10-13 ounces while at work. The Stanford video really helped my production during pumping, but trying to keep both attachments on and massage is tricky.
