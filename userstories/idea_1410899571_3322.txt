Not everyone has a private place to pump at work.  How about a pump that can be put on at the beginning of the work day and worn inconspicuously beneath normal clothes.  Let it be operated by a battery pack and let it pump into a chilled reservoir worn kind of like a fanny-pack (rather than pumping into bottles protruding from the breasts).  Thus one could pump while still working / without the trouble of "set-up" in a non-private location.
