Finally! The pump needs a serious makeover. I have the medella freestyle and use the freeme cups. I love being hands fee and I think they are a lot more comfortable than the alternative but I do still wish they weren't so big and I would love to be able to pump lying down. Or at least reclined. My back always hurts after pumping. Why not make the part that suctions the breasts small and easy to slip into a bra and have the milk flow into a tube and into a bottle or bag you can attach to you hip or lay on the bed? I'm not sure how that would would but a handsfree system that you can use while laying down would be a winner for me.
