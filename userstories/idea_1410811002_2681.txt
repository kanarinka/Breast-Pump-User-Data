As a Breastfeeding Peer Counselor, I think daily... how is it that we have battery operated power tools that can cut through almost anything but no efficient battery operated breastpump. I see the struggles of women. Having a backpack inspired breastpump that would be compatible with the hands-free nursing bras would be a lifesaver for so many women, especially those with young toddlers that need free hands to parent with. Please, please, please consider this in your ideas. 

I cannot have any more children but... I can help those that can. I am very excited to hear that you are tackling this issue. Thank you for all of the women who desire to breastfeed but have challenges, as well as those who are returning to work and are in search of the perfect breast pump fit for them.
