Something easy to clean / sterilise
Electric and non-electric options (for the travelling mom)
Something that can pack flat!  and is not bulky (need to take a huge bag to work these days...)
Can store milk directly in the bags (instead of bottle and transfer)
Something that doesn't require a special bra / complicated clips for hands-free
