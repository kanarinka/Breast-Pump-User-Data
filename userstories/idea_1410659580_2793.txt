Moms who pump exclusively have a need to pump everywhere, not just on their couch. Hands-free and mobile (untethered!) are a must. Many of us also pump in the car (it's the best use of our commute time!). Freemies are a step in the right direction, but we need to be able to see the nipple in the flange. We also need to be able to MOVE and use our arms to reach for things (like our babies!). Being able to pump while lying down would probably extend several EPers' success as it would shorten the middle of the night wake up time after waking to feed the baby.
