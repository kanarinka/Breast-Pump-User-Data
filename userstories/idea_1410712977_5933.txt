I already have an idea, 'the idea' I believe that will make pumping suck a lot less. I'm a mom and and an IBCLC as well as product developer. I have not been able to find an engineer or manufacturing facility locally to be able to prototype my idea for me. Are you a company that can do that? What is the company? When the idea I have becomes successful, then what happens? 
Thanks
