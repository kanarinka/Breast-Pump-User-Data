The "breast shields" make no sense whatsoever. They're suppose to mimic the mouth and auction of baby, since when is a baby's mouth hard and plastic? They should be completely soft and flexible, they should surround the nipple as if a baby was actually nursing.  

Thanks for letting the world be apart of this.
