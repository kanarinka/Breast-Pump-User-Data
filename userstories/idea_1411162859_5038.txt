Thank you!

I've been dreaming of a better pump in the next two years for my next baby. I exclusively breastfed my son for four months in leave. He was a happy fat little man when I returned to work and faced the pumping challenge.

1. Please, please make a pump that has better nipple manipulation. My first week at work was heartbreaking because I couldn't pump enough to keep him fed during the day. I tried two different pumps and a hospital rental all to no avail. All three pumps came with the same hard plastic flange. Sure you could increase suction, but that did nothing. I could put on full and no increase in supply.

2. Better fluctuation in speed and manipulation would also help. I could get a little more milk when I adjusted the suction rate several times in one session. Maybe make a customizable fluctuation option so the mom can best mimic her baby's tempo

3. Laying or leaning back would be awesome.

4. Good portability and ability to switch between smaller hand pump for travel and back to electric pump for on site.

So wish I could be there!
