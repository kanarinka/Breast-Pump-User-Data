Any chance the flanges and the ends could be shorter- so you don't have extra elbows under your cover? Maybe they could pump directly into bags as an option? How about batteries on each pump and gasp! Cordless system? Why can't a little pump exists right on the collector or flange and have them charge wirelessly on the base?
