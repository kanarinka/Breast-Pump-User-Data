The worst part about pumping, for me, was nipple chafing! I didn't know it was ok to lubricate with coconut or olive oil and the lactation consultants were hesitant to see me. Literally, "Well if you're not actually breastfeeding I'm not sure what I can do for you."

Also difficult, I found the right size flange but the tube wasn't long enough- I kept banging my nipple against the "wall". Ow, ow, ow. 

I quit breastfeeding when I went back on my anti-depressants. There's no research done as to whether they'll affect the baby. I need them to function right now, but I don't want to mess up his brain chemistry in the process. There's just no winning! D:

Pump-breastfeeding Moms need support, too.
