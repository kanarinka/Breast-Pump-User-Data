Prevent the tubes on the Medela pumps from getting condensation during and after pumping.  

Time saving measures for setting up prior to pumping and cleaning up after pumping.  Design an all-in-one pump valve, membrane, shields, tubes, etc...which would cut down on time needed assemble the parts prior to pumping and clean them after each pumping session.  Working moms are under pressure to take as little time as possible to pump and for many of us, we need to carry our pump to a private space each time we use it and set everything up, pump, clean everything, pack up, and return to our desk.  The packing/unpacking takes time.
