Soft, flexible flanges in a wide variety of sizes (both the part of the breast and the nipple width/length) 

Quiet and small (smaller than a shoe box)

Independently control speed and suction

"Hospital grade" suction possible

Some way to have the suction/stimulation go further back into the flange--vibrating/massaging flanges?

Carrying case that is easy to clean

Multiuser (so important!! who wants to create a bunch of trash!)

Cost under $200

Internal rechargeable battery -- doesn't need to be plugged in to use (the Hygeia Enjoye is a good example of doing this well)

Easily able to switch from double to single pumping (ideally with a button, switch, on the pump). I don't want to have to unplug things and stop them off with tiny stoppers that get lost!
