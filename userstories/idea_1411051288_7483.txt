I work as a Lactation Specialist and I am so frustrated with breast pumps!  Glad to see this happening.

My suggestion is to have the flange be flexible and to have mechanics on the outside of the flange (possibly controlled by then handle of  manual pump) to mimic the movement if baby's tongue. Babies don't suck (as you know), rather they use their tongue in a wave like fashion to signal mother's body and also to move the milk from theilk sinuses out. Moms who pump mimic this as best they can when using self expression to remove milk and even when using hands on pumping. It would be amazing to mimic this using the actual flange. 
Thank you!
