I like the kiinde system.  You pump directly into a bag, which can be used as a bottle. Maybe develop a storage bag/ container that is more breastlike. Soft, silky, and warm. Which has the capability to attach to any nipple your baby prefers. 
Or the pump could mold around your nipple just like baby tounge and recreate something like your baby does for better milk production. 
But the biggest thing is the redundancy. Pump then feed. How about pumping right into babies mouth through a nipple attatched to pump. That would have been awesome.
