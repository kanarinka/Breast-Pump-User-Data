I'm so excited about this project! 

I hate how loud my pump is and how bulky it is. It makes pumping discreetly almost impossible. 

Also, there are so many parts to cart around-- forgot one at home? Forget about pumping! 

Most importantly, I wish it was more efficient at removing milk. Nothing like spending an hour of your work day pumping only to remove a fraction of your milk! 

Thanks for your work!
