Although not a pumping mom currently, I spent several years pumping while breastfeeding my 2 boys. The discomfort and inconvenience of pumping meant that despite feelings of sadness at the end of my breastfeeding journey, I was not even slightly sad to be finished pumping. I'm sure this has been brought up by others, but I'd love to see a breast pump that is lighter in weight, smaller in size, and much quieter, while not sacrificing in the area of power. I traveled extensively while pumping, and lugging it along with my bags and finding private space to pump was not easy. In airports oftentimes I was huddled in bathrooms, and on car trips I was usually squished into the front seat (sometimes with a cover depending on where we were parked). A pump whose flanges could also be worn, hands-free, would alleviate a lot of trouble and inconvenience. Finally, speed is a factor for a lot of folks. Granted, you can't really speed up all aspects of feeding, but adding features that more closely mimic the way a baby nurses would allow for faster expression of milk. Thanks so much for all of your hard work on this!
