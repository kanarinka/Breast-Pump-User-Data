Hello,
I am a working mom of two.  My daughter is nursing and 3 months old.  I hate pumping more than anything, but I love my kids more.
I wish the flanges were not made of plastic, I hate plastic.  Why can't the parts be silicone?
I wish I could pump and not be attached to a wall, walking around hands free and pumping would be amazing!!!
Thanks,
