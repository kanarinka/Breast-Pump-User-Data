It sucks to have leave friends and family or have to go home in the middle of a party to go pump. Yeah I can only go out somewhere for 3 hours because then I'll need to pump. So not only does your life revolve around your new babies schedule, but Aldo your pumping schedule. It's just too much.

I know this is a long post but I'd also like to mention how there is not really a community or support for moms who have to pump exclusively. It sucks to have to always explain yeah I breast feed but through pumping. There doesn't seem to be common language to use. None if the baby book talk about what to do if your baby won't nurse and you have to pump. How often and how long. And how do keep this up for 12 months. I mean I figured it out but it would have been helpful to have that guidance and support.
