To me, i think the most improvement could come from redesigning the part that actually attaches to your boob. The hands free bras that are sold to hold them in place feel imperfect. To start, maybe make the cone-shaped thingy that attaches to your boob not see thru. It is a total mindfuck to look down and see your nipples distend and distort. 

Make the pump sharable between multiple users.

Make the actual pump mechanism more capable of sustaining several pumping sessions for over one year.
