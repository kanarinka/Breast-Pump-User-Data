Something more portable. I often missed chances to pump while at work (am a labor and delivery nurse) so a smaller motor that is more quiet and can easily clip to a bra or waist band (think like the new insulin pumps) with smaller/more flat flanges - the huge cone flanges used to put to the breast etc are too big and bulky. So something more flat and attaches to some kind of collection bag (think of an ostomy type bag) - the end goal would to have a quiet pump that's barely noticeable so that I could wear under my scrubs/clothes while working and simply turn it on when I need to pump- yeah the session might need to be longer than 15 min to fully empty but still way better than not pumping. Women who work in offices or other service industries would be able to more discreetly pump, it would be easier to pack as carry on for a plane ride. We have so many other crazy awesome medical devices but breast pumps are stuck in the dark ages still!!!!
