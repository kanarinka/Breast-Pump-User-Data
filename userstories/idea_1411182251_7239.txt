I'm an exclusive pumper due to daughter's tongue tie. My Medela Symphony works pretty well but it's not actually portable. I ended up dragging it around in the car and around the house as needed and actually rented a second one for work because it was too heavy to transport daily. What I would like is the Symphony pump in a portable size/weight! I like the pumping speed and action better on the Symphony than my freestyle. The Symphony feels "smoother" somehow.

Also: I'd like to be able to use different suction strengths on each side. Sometimes they just need different things.
