The ideal breast pump should consist of fewer parts. This would definitely contribute to convenience of pumping on-the-go or during working hours! The cleaning process will be less time-consuming. Assembling parts before use is critical especially when there is time limitation during work. Some of the moms might not get a proper space or facility (eg. Table) for pumping and thus the lesser the parts the more convenient it will be. 

Sterilizing the pump is important. If the parts are made in shapes that could be easily brushed or cleaned, it will be a perfect pump for me. It eases my worries on the possibility of bacterial growth in certain "un-reachable" part like tubing, etc.
