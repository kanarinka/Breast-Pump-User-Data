Breast shields that are custom fitted so that the tissue of her areola and nipple are not irritated when she pumps.  Depending on the tissue elasticity, breast shape and breast size, different types of shields work for different types of breasts.  Some breasts have more elasticity and almost nothing works to alleviate the pain that occurs from stretching.

Research into how to improve flow rates for different types of breast tissue.  Research with sonograms has shown that duct size varies considerable.  I don't think anyone has looked into the elasticity of the surrounding breast tissue and the elasticity of the ducts.  I think that women with more elastic breasts may be prone to having their ductal tissue "collapse" while pumping making it difficult for the milk to flow.  These women might respond more readily to an entirely type of shield that might massage from the of the breast forward while also creating negative pressure.
