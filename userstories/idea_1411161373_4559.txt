Hi,

I don't have a specific solution to this, but I would love a breast
pump that doesn't leak when I'm moving/eating/typing while using it.
So much wasted milk and/or time! Currently, because of my arm
movements, it often tends to leak in the connection between my breast
and the flange.

Good luck!
