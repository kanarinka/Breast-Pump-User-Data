I have been a lactation consultant for the past 11 years.  I am currently working in a children's hospital where many babies are not able to eat, so their mothers are exclusively pumping.  I would LOVE to see pump flanges that angled so that mothers did not need to lean forward to keep the milk from leaking out the sides of the flanges.  (This is especially challenging for mothers who have had C-sections, or mother's who are also sick and need to pump in bed.)  Thanks!
