It's got to be first and formost effective and pain free. With easy sized flanges for all mothers. I'd like to see a size chart for flanges. Not to be additional cost. ( every mother has a different size breast and nipple).

To optimize the maximum amount of milk in the shortest amount of time. Obviously duel pumping. 
Inform the Mother with a beep or something when her supply has slowed down, and  progress to gentle massage  to stimulate second let down phase. Or possibly third?

Possibly a way to make the pump personal, allow recording of two minutes at start of pumping of her baby, making sounds? Different colors of pumps. Front part to insert photograph of her baby.
Car charger included in package.
And lastly if you want to sell it, make it attractive to insurance companies!
