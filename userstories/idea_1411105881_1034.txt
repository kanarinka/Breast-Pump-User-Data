Having a radio attached would be wonderful. 
The drone of the pump sevetal times a day for 
15-20 minutes a session can be tiresome and having
 a radio/mp3 player attached to the unit so I wont
 forget it, or have to dig for it in my purse/bag. Also,
 super fast extraction...but I dont know how to improve
this aspect.
