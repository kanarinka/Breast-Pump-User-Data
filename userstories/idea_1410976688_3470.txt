* Spill-proof bottles. There is nothing sadder to a pumping momma than watching that milk be spilled by an elbow that went awry or unstable tabletop in those few seconds after the attachments have been removed and before a cap has been put on it. 
* Fewer parts to clean and subsequently forget when you're leaving the house.I have to take such careful inventory each day to ensure I don't leave anything behind. One missing piece/part can ruin the entire thing & keep me from being able to pump that day. 
* Rechargable/build-in battery for the time when a plug is not available.
* Something a bit quieter
* Pump bags that are not only stylish, but can also function as laptop bag or otherwise. I hate lugging a purse, work bag and pump to the office every. single. day. 
* An easier way to know which size flanges to use
* Add a timer onto the outside of the pump
