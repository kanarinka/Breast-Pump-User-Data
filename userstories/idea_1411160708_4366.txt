Hi,
I'm breastfeeding my third child and pump at work. I have a 30 min drive to and from work, I've always said if I could pump and drive it would save SO much time! That would be less pumping at work and at home.
Thanks for listening!
Great article ! I'm happy to hear there's attempt at improvements !
