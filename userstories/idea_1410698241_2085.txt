I'm EPing again with baby #2. I currently use 3 Medela pumps. Symphony at home, Pump in Style paid by insurance at work, and my 4 yo Freestyle that I purchased before the ACA I use while out and about. I can say definitively that having the pumping mechanism be 2 instead of 1 is much better at consistent suction. Both the Symphony and the Freestyle have 2 suctions. The PIS is terribly weak with its one large sucker. Of the 3 the Freestyle feels the most like natural breastfeeding. It's still not even close, but its leagues closer than the Symphony or PIS. I think this is because the suction is right at the breasts, so the vibration of the suction at the breast sorta-kinda mimics that good deep suction action my son can do with a good latch.
