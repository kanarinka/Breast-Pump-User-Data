Hello,
 
I was recently forwarded an email about your initiative on breastmilk and breast pumps.  I am MIT graduate in my 2nd year of MBA at HBS and also a Mom of 3.  I breastfed and pumped when I went back to work for all 3 of my children and wanted to share some thoughts from that perspective:
 
- the decision to pump or not has much less to do with technology than the work environment and cultural expectations.  Granted, if a woman cannot afford a pump, she would not be able to pump, but for those women, their work (and sometimes home) environment do not allow them the luxury to take breaks of 20min+ at least twice a day (outside of lunch hour) to pump.  
 
- Another issue to consider is that breastmilk is more sensitive to mishandling than formula.  If pumped in unsanitary conditions or stored improperly, spoiled or contaminated breastmilk would cause more harm than good to the baby.  The risks of such may be even higher for women of low-income means.  
 
While I applaud your wish to encourage more breastfeeding and pumping, I wonder if the focus might be better rewarded if it were on changing the cultural norms and employer benefits than improving technology.  In the U.S. alone, breastpumping at work is still very much an unknown phenomenon.  I've had male workers (at progressive, high-tech firms) completely oblivious to what this is, and not understand why I cannot just reschedule it to attend another meeting.  Shouldn't we fix things domestically first before venturing into other countries?
 
An alternative to consider is to create a co-op where women donate used breastpumps to a non-profit organization that can lend high-quality pumps as well as all attachments to women in need.  This would offer an even more economical (and green) solution.
