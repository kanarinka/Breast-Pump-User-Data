Hello!
 
I work at Lansinoh Laboratories, one of the leaders in products that support breastfeeding moms, and just read about the Fall Hackathon. What a fantastic event! At Lansinoh, our mission is to help moms breastfeed for longer, and making breastfeeding and pumping easier is integral to that mission. Iâ€™d love to know if there are opportunities for our team to get involved with or support your event, so appreciate any information you can send over.
 
Thank you!
