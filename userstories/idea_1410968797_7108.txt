As a Mom who almost exclusively pumps, here's my wish list off the top of my head :-)
-breast shields made of a softer, more pliable material that express milk closer to the way babies express milk when they're nursing...which would hopefully mean you would get the milk out faster
-quieter
-not so bulky, able to move around and do things while pumping
-fewer pieces 
- Something that catches drips of milk as you remove pieces from breast once done pumping
-Not having to lean forward during pumping
-Cute carrying case options
