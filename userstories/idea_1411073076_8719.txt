This is fantastic.  Ok things that could be waaaaay better about a pump:  (1)  There should be full contact with the breast and nipple with a softer, silicone-type material.  Hard plastic cones pinch sensitive skin, and the shape doesn't offer the nipple stimulation of breastfeeding (which causes lots of pumping moms to lose their milk supply).  (2) Why does the bottle have to stick out from your boobs?  The breast connections should be smaller and more discrete with tubes that run down to a single bottle so you could put the pump on under a sweater and have the milk collect under your desk.  (3)  Milk should not be able to get down the pump tubes!!  I spend so much time cleaning my Medela tubes and they basically never get clean.  (4)  The pump itself should  be small and nicely packaged so it's not embarassing to bring to an office.  (5)  And if there's any way to tone down that horrid pumping noise, my office neighbors would be really grateful.  GOOD LUCK!!
