Speed is of the essence at work.
I can feel the breast tissue, find a hard area/undrained duct, press on it...and get the milk out of it in seconds. Simply manipulating and/or pressing on the breast tissue can do this.
Can you make the cup soft and conformable, maybe out of silicone, and then have a rotating ring around it with a lump? I'm picturing a bearing-like setup. As the ball revolves around the breast, it would push inward, gently denting the tissue. Three or four in a row, with one just outside the aureole and the opposite one at the edge, would work together to push the milk towards the nipple.
It could take it from a 20 minute wait to produce a few ounces to getting five ounces in ten minutes (or however much that mom produces).  And NO ONE seems to know the "gentle pressure" trick, either. A flange that can provide a rotating gentle pressure to move milk towards the nipple would be effective; can you make it VERY effective?
