I would love to be able to pump laying down -- as of now I have to pump and slightly lean forward to ensure that the milk goes into the bottles and doesn't just pool in the horns.  I would also love a quieter machine, it's a little embarrassing to close my office door and then turn on this loud machine... it reminds everyone in my office of what I'm doing.  Also, having a way to be mobile somehow would be amazing.  It's hard to just sit down and pump sometimes.  It would be nice to have the flexibility to wash dishes or go to the bathroom while pumping. 

Summary:
-Pump in different positions (laying down, reclining back, on my side)
-Quieter machine
-Mobility (even limited mobility is better than nothing)

So excited to see what comes of this!

Thanks!
