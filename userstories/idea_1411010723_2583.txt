Make them smarter!! Today's NICU moms use smartphones (if they are lucky enough to afford them) to track pumping time, frequency, and milk production. Combine this technology with the pump itself.

Change the flanges! I see nipple breakdown even when the "right" sized flanges are used in exclusively pumping moms. Could a more soft, flexible material be used? This might also allow mom's to use "hands on pumping techniques" described in Stanford Medical's "Making More Milk" DVDs, by letting them better conform to the breast and maintain a seal with more flexibility.

Make them smaller and lighter, because how do I have an iPhone that could run the world, but had chronic pain in my shoulders and chest from hauling a huge pump around when I was pumping for 3 years. 

Thanks for what you're doing!
