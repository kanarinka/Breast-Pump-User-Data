Super excited about this program! I am exclusively pumping 7+/day. When I was breastfeeding, my baby was way more efficient in draining the breast and getting a letdown compared to my hospital grade pump. I wish the suction did a better job and there was a way to pump in a reclined position without needing all these extra adapters that are sold on the market.
