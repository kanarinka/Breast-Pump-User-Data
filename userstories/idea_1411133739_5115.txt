*Flexible flanges made of a softer material 
(maybe something like a silicone material that they use for some new style icecube trays) that allow the milk to drain down and be collected rather than make the milk pool in the flange. 

*A single piece that can be easily cleaned. 
(The medela system I currently use has 5 parts for each side (10 parts that need to individually cleaned every day)

*Want to be hands free 
A breast pump flange system that can be Worn easily. Want to be hands free and able to do other things while pumping. Currently a separate bra needs to be purchased in order to pump hands free.

*A portable system. 
Currently the Medela Symphony ( the cream of the crop for pumps) has to be lugged around and when you are pumping you are tethered to the pump - the tubing is only about 3 feet long.
