Definitely need the ability to adjust the speed and the strength if suction. Some pumps claim to have both function (ie Hygeia Enjoye) but in fact does not have both (in my experience, it felt like only increasing the strength not the speed). 

So, it needs to have separate dials to control the speed and strength--they cannot be one and the same. The Medela pump in style has a "let down" button, which allows for a timed, quick speed suction (does not change strength of suction--there is a separate dial for controlling suction strength), that is ok but it'd be better to allow this to be a customized function that permits mom to control speed. 

Provide multiple flange sizes with the pump kit.
