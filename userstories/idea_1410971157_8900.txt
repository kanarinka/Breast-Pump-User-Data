Wish the motor was a lot quieter. My bike tire pump is more quiet than my breast pump. The cone can be alot softer, not as hard. Better suction and less strain. Some electrical pumped said they emulated baby suckling but that's a lie. Less parts or make hoses to be clean easier. Battery use need to last longer, I have gone through so much batteries because plugging in was not an option most of the time. I produce way too much milk, that cause the pump to back suck into the machine. You should something to sometime about it. The cone should mold a women breast, holding a hard cone to breast sometime hurts and uncomfortable.  Wish there us way you can pumped lying down. There should be a hand free opt a hand free option or style of breast pumped. Breast pumped are already expensive and try buying a tube top looking thing  that advertised hand free breast pumping  is sometime not in the budget when you spend a 1/3 of your paycheck buying A breast pump!
