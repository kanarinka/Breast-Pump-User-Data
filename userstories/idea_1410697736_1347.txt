I'm interested in something more natural, more naturally shaped, that fits better, and has a more natural pump/suction. I had a Madela and pumped at work for 2 years. I can't imagine anyone saying that using a pump was anywhere near similar to nursing. Just like some baby brains get confused between bottle and breast, some mama brains get confused between baby and pump. I don't understand all the requests to be able to pump hands free so you can do something else. Don't get me wrong, hands free would be awesome, but I think for some, there is an important mental/bonding/relaxing component that signals your body to let milk flow. Hands free so I can do something relaxing, like look at pictures of my baby. A quieter pump, would help. I always was in a hurry to be done pumping. Anything that can be done to make it less awkward would be really great.
