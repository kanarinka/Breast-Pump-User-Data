I want to be able to pump lying down, with soft shields, and have as much sucking power as my baby. She could empty me in 5-8 minutes. My breast pump took 20. It would be great if it was silent so when I pumped at work I could also conference call at the same time. And it would be nice if I did not have to hold the shields on my breasts during my 20 minute pump sessions (I.e., go hands free!).
