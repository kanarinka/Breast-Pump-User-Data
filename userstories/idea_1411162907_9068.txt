For these reasons:

1. Limited efficacy
2. Hospital grade pumps are the only ones that somewhat function/produce
3. LOUD!!!!!!!
4. Sooooooooo costly ;( :( ;(
5. UNCOMFORTABLE!!!!!
6. many existing pumps cannot be sterilized and therefore are unsanitary and also therefore cannot be sold / shared / upcycled / gifted
