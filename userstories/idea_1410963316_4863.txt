I wish I could have laid down, even on my side, without worrying about spillage. I had to pump twice at night to keep up with my little ones needs, and if I could just have laid down and relaxed while doing it, it would have been a relief! Also, the turn in the connectors are nearly impossible to properly clean! Drove me nuts and had us constantly on the cusp of thrush!

Thank you, thank you!!
