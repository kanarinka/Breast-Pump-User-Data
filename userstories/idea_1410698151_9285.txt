So many great ideas have already been posted. For myself, I would love it if pumping didn't FEEL so clinical and medical. Nursing a baby is such an intimate, close encounter with softness and cuddles and warm feelings. All of mom's senses are involved including touch, sight, smell, hearing. Pumping is the total opposite with loud motors and ugly tubes and feeling rushed and stressed and worried (is enough coming out? Am I drying up? Do I have time for this? Are people looking for me at work? Is this really worth it?). Thank you for taking on such an important challenge!!
