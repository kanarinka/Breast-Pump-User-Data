It would be great if the flanges/breast shields could be made of flexible material. I think this would be much more comfortable and provide better suction on the breast. If this were possible, it would make the process of pumping much easier and reduce waste. It seems that with a rigid breast shield, even the slightest of movements causes the suction to be disrupted, resulting in leakage/waste, and preventing the user from doing anything but sitting completely still while pumping. It's nearly impossible to get anything done if you can't make even the slightest movement, and If you're someone like me who needs a good half hour to pump this can be very frustrating. Thanks!
