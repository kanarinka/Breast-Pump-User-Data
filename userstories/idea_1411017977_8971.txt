Make the cones and whatever additional attachments necessary not have small crevices that are impossible to wash where milk fat can get stuck and start turning funky colors. It's as if the current manufacturers make it so you HAVE to throw out your cones and after a while and buy new ones. 

Come up with a light yet powerful pump that can be strapped onto a mother of more than one who has a million and one other things to do while pumping. I recommend coming up with a pumping bra specifically designed to go hand in hand with a specific pump so that the cones don't fall off or shift around while mom is doing her million and one things. 

Thank you in advance if you come up with a non-sucky breast pump design! Mommas would love you.
