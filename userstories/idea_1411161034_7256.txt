> Thanks so much for posting about the breast pump hackathon.  As a family doctor with an interest in breastfeeding medicine and breastfeeding mother of 2 I have spent a lot of time using and teaching others about breast pumps.  I agree that we can do better.

> I have 2 suggestions for a better breast pump.  First is to make flanges which compress the breast to encourage full emptying but maintain hands free convenience.  This would be very helpful for those of us working on a computer while pumping.  While perusing groupon several weeks ago I ran across breast compressors which I thought were for increasing milk supply, but were actually intimate adult toys, so there may be existing technology which could be adapted.  The second is to make a lower profile set up at the breast so it could be worn under clothing.  The idea would be you could slip the flange inside your nursing bra in private, attach the pump itself to your belt, then scrub into the OR or sit in a lecture or meeting and truly multitask.  This goes along with a quieter motor of course.

> As national legislation moves to support and protect breastfeeding, there is going to be a larger market and more demand for a better breast pump.  Breastfeeding saves lives.  Thanks for all of your hard work, I would love to be a part of it.
