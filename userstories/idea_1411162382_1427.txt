I, myself, am an engineer and working mother.  I have 2 children, both of whom were breastfed.  I exclusively pumped for both of them when I returned to work for a variety of reasons.  While I was successful with pumping, it was not met with challenges.  Some things to consider when designing a breastpump that were important to me are:
-Quietness of the motor, many times I was pumping while on conference calls and I did not want my coworkers to hear my motor
-Ability to really express milk more like an infant would
-Ability to function without losing suction
-Quality of the motor to work and function and not die like most pumps do for exclusively pumping mothers
-Cleanliness: a lot of pumps are open systems, which is a breeding ground for mold
-Ease of cleaning said pump, again this ties in with the open vs. closed system
-Size, many pumps are very large and bulky.  It can be embarrassing to carry around such a large bag
-Minimize leaking: often while pumping leaking does occur and milk gets all over the mother's clothes.  Additionally, this also means precious liquid gold is lost.

Thank you so much for this event, this is just incredible and I know myself along with all the other breastfeeding moms out there appreciate what you are trying to do.
