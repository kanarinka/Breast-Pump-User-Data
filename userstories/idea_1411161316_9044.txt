I read your recent article and had a few suggestions based on my own pumping experience.  First, it would be great to design something that you don't need pipe cleaners and old toothbrushes to adequately get the crevices of the pump parts clean- too many tiny spaces that a sponge/whatnot just won't fit. 

Second, it would be great to somehow design the pump so that the milk coming out of the breast aims downward into the bottles.  I felt I could not lean back in my chair and relax while pumping because then gravity causes the expressed milk to collect in the flange instead of flowing down into the bottle and then leaks out all over my shirt.  This caused me to either sit very upright or lean slightly forward to have the milk move with gravity down into the collecting bottle.  Wouldn't it be nice if we could pump reclined?  Or even laying down??  It would be great to be able to program the pump for 20 minutes automatically and then pump either reclining/whatnot at 3AM and take a little nap while the magic happens.  Or at least lean back and close my eyes instead of standing stiffly upright like a soldier, or slightly hunched forward.  Especially for those moms struggling with supply who are trying to pump every 2 hours (and when it takes 20-30 minutes to pump - that means actually pumping every 1.5 hours!). 

Thanks for writing this article!  Pumping is just terrible.  It would be cool to be able to record the sound of your baby crying or sucking or cooing to be played while pumping- I personally would look at a picture of my baby when I couldn't be with him and I found that helped. 

Most importantly, however, I think is the larger societal picture of breastfeeding support for women in the US.  Support for pumping, support for staying home with your baby as long as possible.  Until we change that, even an amazing pump is not going to solve the problem.
