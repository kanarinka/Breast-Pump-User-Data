Wow this is great!! Thank you so much brainy people for going forth on this effort to improve my new best gal pal/worst enemy. You are appreciated! So enough with the sentiments.....please figure out a way to make a less noisy pump. I have been on more than one conference call where people have asked "what is that noise?" So embarrassing!  Also I hate the little plastic part that attaches to the flanges and filters the milk only because it is such a pain in the ass to clean.  Milk dries in the little channel and I have not found a bristle small enough to clean it. Thank you again! I can't wait to see what you come up with.
