I've read the article and I think it's great, even if it just remain as ideas/concept. 

I myself only can afford to buy a breast pump after the baby is six months old. 

These are my ideas, hope you'll look into it. I hope you guys can come up with the best ideas in the world.

- Make breast pump affordable, baby formula is hell expensive. Most heavy duty breast pump are expensive, too that make SAHM like me found it really hard to get a decent one. 

-Breast pump that can attach to a milk storage bag

- Since you suggested an opaque breast pump bottle, maybe can make it to auto stop when it detected full, thus avoiding overflowing

- Make pumping while multitasking easier, such as freemie storage bottle where we don't struggle with adjusting the bottle. the tech. is there, but it is not the standard. kinda hard to pump on nursing pillow while breastfeeding the baby at the same time.


Thanks.
