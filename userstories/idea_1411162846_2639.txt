Hard plastic flanges that must be pressed against sore, engorged breasts!!!  Something soft & a little flexible would be so much better.  Maybe something that could be heated or refrigerated (and stay warm/cold) for comfort.

Flanges that don't fit!

Storage bags that are difficult to pour into/out from, difficult to seal, too easy to spill!

Leaks / drips if you shift while pumping!

No hands-free options for larger breasts- bustiers and other "fixes" don't work!

Nursing bras!  I need a nursing bra I can wear to work & in public - with real support!

The tubes that get dirty with Medella pumps- yuck!

The fragile & difficult to clean parts of every pump!

The noise!  Lansinoh sounds like a cow, Medella not much better.

The posture needed and leaks that happen if you try to take a break or move!
