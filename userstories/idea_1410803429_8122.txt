My ideal breastpump is:

Handsfree! So that I can read or use the computer or whatever while pumping. 

Sealed-system so that it retains some resale value - or a design that is more inexpensive so that's not an issue. 

QUIET and fast. If my baby can empty my breasts in 10 minutes, it shouldn't take twice that to pump. 

Non-chafing and gentle. 

GUYS! I am so excited you're doing this.
