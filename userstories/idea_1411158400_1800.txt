My baby had health issues and couldn't have any food other than breastmilk until about age 2. I was a prolific breastfeeder and round-the-clock pumper. Things that would have improved my experience:
1. quieter pump 
2. smaller (more discrete, and/or portable)
3. tubes that did not mold. even though I was careful about tube care, when I lived in a hotter/wetter climate (San Diego), they seemed to mold no matter what, and I was always ordering new ones. when we relocated to the Bay Area I didn't have this problem. (also, tube replacements weren't sold in stores and required internet ordering).
4. stronger "flappers". it was the worst (okay, bothersome) when they would rip and I didn't have any replacements on hand. midnight trips to target were not fun! 
Thank you so much for devoting your time and effort to this project!
