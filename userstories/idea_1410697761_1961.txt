Also would love a pump to have some basic self diagnostics, like telling you when the motor is no longer working to suck at proper capacity. Many moms struggle to figure out breastfeeding and pumping in the beginning and sometimes mistakenly think something is wrong with their bodies (drying up) instead of being able to easily see that there is something wrong with their pump.
