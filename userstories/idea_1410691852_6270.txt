Where to start? Hands free on its on merit (without having to buy extra accessories).  Quieter so my co-workers don't have to ask what the whooshing noise is? Built in radio? Gentle massager? Self sealing for the bottles or bags so we spill less? I wouldn't have been able to nurse three babies longer than a year as a working mom without the pump, but wow, it was good to put the pump away at the end!
