I was just thinking about this innovation this week. Develop a breast pump similar to a wound vac. Something that may attach to your breast more than for just one pump, but something that attaches perhaps for the entire day/night. Pump that may have the option of constantly and more silently pump continuously throughout the day, vs program it so that it can cycle and turn on at a setting, such as for 15 min every 3hrs. It should also be closer to your chest and inconspicuous so you can wear it all day without being obvious. It should also have a running that attached to a contraption, perhaps a poise, where you can intermittently search or and store it.
Please research the wound vac for more ideas.
