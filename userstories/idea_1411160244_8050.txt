Saw a post on the facebook page for my local La Leche League about your project. First, THANK YOU! I am a nursing mom of a 10 month old and I detest pumping for all of the reasons mentioned in the article.

Couple ideas I didnt see mentioned... make the flange piece flat(ish) so it can be inserted and held in position by a bra. Portability was discussed but what about mobility: Could storage bags ('cause who freezes milk in a bottle??) and the motor be totally mobile? I am thinking walkman or fanny pack style. Then the mother could be on the go, completing tasks or chasing after older kids.

Thanks again and best of luck!
