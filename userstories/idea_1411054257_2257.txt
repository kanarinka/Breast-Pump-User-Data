Other than the obvious- noise, less painful suction... The one that bugs me about my pump(both of them) is size.. My hospital grade is too big to carry with me, so I have a Medela I take for work.  I'm gone all day that bad does not have enough cooler storage for a full day of milk plus the bottles I pump with.  I used to have a back pack Medela, now I have a new one that is khaki and seems made for insurance companies..  Since all moms storage needs are different, I wish this pump was just that, a pump with maybe one pocket for one pair of pump parts, the tubes and the power adapter.. I don't want a cooler pack.. I tend to store my milk in my lunch bag or in the refrigerator at work.. I'd wish the pump was small enough to fit in my lunch box, or in a smaller 31 bag so I didn't have to carry this ugly oversized bag..  I carry enough bags a day and I'm tired of looking like I'm going on a weekend trip just to goto work every day.
