Hello,
I think this is such a brilliant endeavor and as a mother who exclusively pumps, I'd like to offer some suggestions on what would be really beneficial. I exclusively pumped for the first six months of my son's life and felt forced to stop after that as he became increasingly mobile and it became so difficult to take care of him while pumping at the same time. 

I think a big part of making pumping easier, would be to make the flanges and tubing smaller and sleeker. It's very difficult to pick up a crying baby etc when you have to sit attached to a pump. On the rare occasions that I did, the baby would pull the tubing out and generally interrupt the flow. It's also vital to pumping success to have skin to skin contact, which would be more easily achieved with a smaller design. Also, for working mothers who have very little time to pump in the office, it's a huge pain to have to undress the top and put a hands free bra on. Anything to make the pumping process quicker would be a huge help. At the height of my pumping, I was doing it 12x/day for 20-30 mins each time. 

Being able to pump while laying down would be a fantastic addition as well. A lot of pumping mothers have had C sections and need more time to rest while pumping. A light would be great as well because many moms have to do it at least once in the middle of the night, since that is when the milk production is as its highest. Maybe some type of reflective light up style..

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this and for your efforts helping mothers get breast milk to their babies in the most efficient way possible.
