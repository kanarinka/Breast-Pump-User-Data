Hi there!

I saw this on Engadget and I am excited to share my pumping experience.

I am a working mother to 2 beautiful girls, ages 3 and 8 months respectively.
I am currently breastfeeding my 8 month old, and I am so glad I can keep breastfeeding and pumping for her, to reap the health benefits for both of us.

Please let me know if you need anything further from me, before I give you my whole shpiel :)

I look forward to it!
