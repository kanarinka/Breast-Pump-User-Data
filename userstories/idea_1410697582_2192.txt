Thanks for the add! I would also like to introduce the idea that the flanges should work more like the infant's mouth, with more compression of the breast tissue to stimulate let down and keep up flow of milk. It should mimic the actual muscle movement/coordination of the infant's jaw as well as provide suction. Mimicking those movements could drastically increase milk flow/production during pumping times for thousands of mothers.
