I idea is using a centrifugal style pump instead of the typical reciprocating style. 
Have this mated with a programmed relief valve to simulate suction off and on like a baby does, both during the letdown phase and normal nursing. 
Also included would still be the manual bypass for suction intensity, and another dial for speed. 
The reasoning behind the centrifugal pump is that it will run for MUCH longer without breaking down. (Something that the Affordable Care Act is giving us a LOT of out in the field right now) More pump output means low quality from manufacturers.
