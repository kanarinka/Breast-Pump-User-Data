Got the medela PIS free for my third kid this summer. Bought the PIS for my first before they were covered. They're fine- some condensation in tubes but does a decent job. New one didn't come w the battery pack and I NEED it for work when I travel so I was glad to already have it. Not sure I would've thought it existed if it didn't come with the first one.
