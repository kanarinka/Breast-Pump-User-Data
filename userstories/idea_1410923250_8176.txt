(My credentials:  I breast-fed two kids and worked full-time, my freezer was white and full of milk for daycare)
The pump needs to be discreet so that she can wear it under her shirt like a catheter and collecting bag. It could attach to the woman the same way as a bathing cap does.  Maybe have a kit that she could mold her own formfitting, air-tight covering with. It could be produced by the person herself like a rubber mask or how a bald wig is made. I made a set of buck teeth with a molding kit once. The kit would need to contain enough of the substance to create two or three different sizes, depending on engorgement/time away from her baby, or have them pre-made for busy moms. The attachment/pump part would have to be flat so that it could be worn under her shirt so that the woman could discreetly continue to work and have the milk collecting into a pocketbook type sling bag.  It has to have rechargeable batteries, cordless. The milk should collect into a thermos-type container so that she doesn't have to run around looking for a refrigerator.
