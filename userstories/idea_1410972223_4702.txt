Can they be less loud?  I try to do conference calls while using it and people always ask about it.  

Built in lights or light-up options so when I use it at night I don't have to turn on a super bright light to see what I am doing.  

Why don't the bags for these always have a refrigerated section?  90% of the time I pump I am away from my child.  

It is so hard to clean my pump pieces at my desk.  Fewer crevices please.

Closed system! I was having trouble with my pump and a friend offered to let me try theirs.  But I can't because it wasn't a closed system.

Faster cycles for let down.  I need way faster. 

Pumping while leaning back is more comfortable but pumping leaning forward is better for collection device.

I have tiny nipples and it was really hard to find flanges that fit.  Why are there so few options?

Let down isn't just about rapid suction.  Can't we get some massaging in here?  I would be happy to hand stimulate but my fingers can't reach the areola when my flanges are covering them.

A stand for the collection containers after pumping while I am prepping the bag.  If I could tell you the amount of times there were tears after a container got knocked over before its contents went into the bag.  

Moist heat (simulate an infant mouth) on flanges....lets down doesn't happen when the girls are cold. 

Be able to set a timer on the pump that once set wasn't visible.  I hate clock watching to see if I have gone 15 minutes just to look and see how much I am pumping as I go.  Clock watching = stress= less milk

Why is it so much weaker on battery or car adapter?  Just tell me to not bother using it on the go if that is how it is going to be.  

Different shaped collectors.  It is very hard to use a keyboard and not be knocking into them.
