The noise needs to be quieter, a hum, WHAT ABOUT  SOME SOFT MUSIC
The flanges need to be softer and mallleable, hand free( suction cups)
The pump needs a timer maybe a shut off point.
The pump needs to be portable. 
The flanges possibly opaque.  
The pump parts easy to clean.
The breast pump itself uncomplicated on and off switch and control for the vaccum.
This would be a gift to all the mom who are working and pumping.
