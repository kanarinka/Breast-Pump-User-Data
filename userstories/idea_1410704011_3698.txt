Make the breast pump easier to clean and less awkward. I have been breastfeeding for 3+ years of that time I have only pumped 2 monthes because of the awkwardness of the pump and how hard it is to clean the parts. As well as making all of the parts easy to find and accesible. Ex. My dog chewed through the 'air' hoses for my medela pump. I had a very difficult time just finding those without haveing to buy the whole kit again.
