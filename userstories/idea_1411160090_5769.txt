Loved the Medium post. What an admirable challenge with so much room for improvement!

As a working mom, I've definitely noticed that one of the most challenging parts of the pumping experience is travel. Flying is particularly awful if you are having to pump. Hiding in airplane bathrooms, causing long lines, cleaning parts, storing milk, shipping it back, etc. Just plain awful. I once forgot my pumping bra on a trip and the flight-pumping experience was something out of a Mr. Bean skit.

I've got quite a few thoughts about this — mainly about the experience more than anything — and would be more than happy to jump on a Google hangout or the like. One very simple idea I've had is around the option of compostable/PLA breast pump parts available for purchase at drug/convenience stores for forgotten parts (when you just don't want to purchase one more part you already own — you just forgot it that day!). As you know, it is so easy to forget one small thing and really mess up the whole system — which is obviously part of the bigger issue.

I'm sure you're getting quite a few emails, but the moms of IDEO have lots of thoughts for you if you want them. ;) Let me know how we can help
