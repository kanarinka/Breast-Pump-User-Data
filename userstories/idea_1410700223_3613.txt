I think the new design of a breastpump can move away from the vacuum/suction mechanism. This pulling and enlarging of the nipple is unnatural and often uncomfortable. A better pump would be one that (from at least three pressure points) rolls down the areola towards the nipple, then compresses the nipple. This compression/squeezing is infinitely more comfortable. I believe comfort may be more important than efficiency for some women. Please contact me at laura.cade.brown@gmail.com for a illustration of how a potential compression pump could be designed.
