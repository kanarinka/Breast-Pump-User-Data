I pumped while driving as well. I used a Medela and I needed the stimulation speed (the first 2 minute cycle) all the time to mimic my LO. I wish I could just set that and pump rather than having to switch back to it every 2 minutes. A handsfree bra and pumpin pals angled flanges made a difference. 

Pumps should come with a car adapter, I think.
