I saw the article in the medium.com, I would like to offer a suggestion.

Why not have the milk pump into a bag. It is typically pumped into bottles which require washing & sanitizing. Most of the time, I would put the milk in milk bags to freeze or because I didnâ€™t have enough bottles. It would be nice just to pump into the bags and remove as use as needed. No hassle of cleaning the bottles since the bags get thrown out.

Thanks.
