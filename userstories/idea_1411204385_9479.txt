Revise cleaning of parts.  For cleaning my tubes, I have been bringing them to the dental office to use the air/water syringe on one end and the high speed suction on the other.  It has been very effective at flushing everything out.  If the design of the pumps are to remove the bottles from the nipples, it would make more sense to have small nipple shield over each breast and the tubing to run down the length of the abdomen, possibly connect to a belt that will collect the milk similar to a catheter bag and could possibly contain the pump as well.  However, having 4 lengths of tubing will make it very difficult unless you have an inexpensive cleaning system that could emulate the process I use at the office.  You could present it as a countertop box that can flush and clean parts automatically.  You would then have 4 lengths of tubing and 2 nipple shields.  If they remain connected, you would only need 2 inputs/2 outputs.  When we need to lubricate handpieces in large quantity, we hook them onto a coupler and the lubricant shoots through and flushes them out.  If the cleaning system can flush everything out and all you need is a water reservoir, dilute soapy reservoir, and alcohol reservoir.  If you focus on the size and noise of the pump by upgrading power tech and change the collected methodology by rethinking the cleaning process, that would be great.
