Would be great to have a compact "bottle" to hold the milk while pumping that make moms more mobile without bulky bottle attached to breasts. Right now, the only available products are single use milk collection bags that are so expensive and definitely not environmentally friendly. 

Pump that could detect let down. Thus, quickly switch from stimulation phase to normal suction. 

Personally, I love manual pump since the suction can be adjusted easily by hand movement. But, it is so annoying that the handheld is so close to the breast make it impossible to pump discreetly while on the go.
