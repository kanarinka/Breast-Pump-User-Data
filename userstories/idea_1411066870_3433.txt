I'm an MIT PhD alumna and a full prof and vice dean and mom of 3 who nursed for a total of 7 years!  I've tried all the pumps, and the best is the manual Avent, because it gives the most control of timing, pace and pressure: so we need that feature.  It's also small and discreet: we need that feature.  It's also quiet: we must have that!  A mom should be able to pump in her economy seat on the plane and not be embarrassed. Ditto during a telecon.  I have done it with the Avent in both circumstances, but I'm not easily embarrassed; most other women are and so they and their babies miss out.  Make it small, silent, and adaptive to the mom's needs in pace, pressure, and timing.
