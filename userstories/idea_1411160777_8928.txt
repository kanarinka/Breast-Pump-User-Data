Hello,
I am a working Mom, and the mother of two preemies, born at 30 and 32 weeks.
The 30 weeker received BM for a full 13 mos, the 32 weeker will be 12 mos this week and has only had BM.
I’m excited to see effort into Pumps. I use an Ameda Platinum and a Medal PISA. I work from home, but go out to see clients. I pump at my desk w/the Ameda (at home), and use the Medela, primarily in my car.
30 weeker – some nursing – more pumping
32 weeker – after 2 mos – he was nursing when w/me  - pumping when appart
I’ve spent 24-25 months with a pump!
 
During my boys NICU Stays, I used the Ameda 95% of the time. Medela if I was going to be somewhere other than the house/NICU. NICU had Ameda’s to use.
 
A few things it took me awhile to figure out or I would love to have:
·         Pumping Bra – they should be sold w/the pumps!

·         Nursing Cover…another must, used it in the NICU, in my family room, in the car

·         More obvious info about flange fit

·         Small parts – need to be more spares in the kits

·         Caring cases for Medela – should be bigger, as I usually need to cary around multiple sets of flanges/parts and sometimes two coolers (hot days).  I have the messenger bag – it should really snap close. Everything doesn’t just automatically “fit” in it.

·         Quieter pump…less distraction

·         Hint/Tricks Card – how to use the pumps to increase letdown, that being distracted (watch TV, read, FB) makes time go by faster & less focus on the stress of filling a bottle.

·         Larger/smaller bottles – flexibility  - less disappointment if lower output – special adaptor for the first few days if in the hospital, maybe a bag insert that can go direct to NICU w/o pouring out a bottle.

·         If there was a way to make the parts smaller – so it doesn’t stick out so far. Parts of the pump smaller/body etc. it would be less noticeable/award. Also easier to clean – my pump stuff takes up a lot of space on the counter, cleaning bins and dishwasher.

·         Longer cords

·         Option for fewer pieces to assemble….try putting it together sitting in a car….or standing in a dirty/germy airport bathroom – and then take it apart or try to get the bottles capped off w/o spilling.

·         Love the Ameda Plat has a timer, and digital adjustments – this should be standard.

·         Love idea of it syncing up to an app. I tried using a few Aps…but it was too much manual input. But auto-sync like a fitbit would be cool. The option to enter in output.

 
THANKS!
