A pump that is truly portable and holds all sizes/brands of bottles, and not just an arbitrary one bottle type would be great. When I couldn't find the right bottles for my bottle holders, I was SOL for a place to stand the bottle with the pump parts attached. Sometimes the bottle would tip and spill while I tried to get the id ready to put on it. Also, battery usage is a big deal. My portable pump ate through batteries at an alarming rate: 6 AA batteries would last only 2 or 3 pumping sessions.
