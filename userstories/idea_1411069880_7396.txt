Would be great to have a pump that has fewer fixtures and not bulky. Something I can place it in my handbag and be charged easily. Have been using my pump for almost a year and find that many times, the suction is not as powerful as the baby is-- especially after 6-8 months of use. The massage of breast accelerates the suction I think.
