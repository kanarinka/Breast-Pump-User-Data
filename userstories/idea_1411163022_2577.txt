My suggestions:

-I would love to be a tester if something comes about!
-easy to clean singular parts
-a way to not have to sanitize that takes time. Maybe something built in after pumping that will sanitize parts?
-accessories that actually work and are useful. Like a carrying bag that actually hold the pump, bottle/bags, pump parts etc. I spent the money for a pump bag and it doesn't hold anything really other than the pump and a few times.
-quiet!!!! No one likes to have the world know you're pumping
-portability and small size
-portable accessories
-make the pump itself modern and stylish

Thanks very much! I look forward to a result!
