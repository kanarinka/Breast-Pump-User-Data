For me, the overall concept for a breast pump should be less "milking cow" and more "nursing mother."  To me, this means flanges that are more "mouth like"- made of a different material and mimicking the movement of a baby's mouth.  A unit that is smaller, quieter, and less obtrusive- in an ideal world the motor would be the size of an ipod and could attach to a mother's clothes allowing her to be truly mobile.  It could  even be a "smart device" that would include a timer, a way to track output, and any number of different statistics (baby's input, weight, sleep patterns, etc.).  Maybe it could "upload" to an app that would track these things on a smart device.  Also, it would changes diapers, feed the baby, and fold laundry.  Thank you!
