I have the medela pump in style in the backpack. The pump is too loud. The milk pools in the flange if you are leaning back. Replacing the membranes is so expensive but in order to get good output you must do so regularly and it adds up if you have more than one set of pumping parts. Hands free bras are also expensive they are a must not an accessorie. The tubing gets to wet inside whole pumping. The backpack has no room in it the pump takes up half the space. The cooler bag is way too small, I pump into 8 oz bottles not 4 oz bottles . Pump is heavy
