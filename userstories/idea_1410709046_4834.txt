I got a Medela In Style insurance pump, used that for 6 months. Ran into supply drop coming back to work (really problematic maternity leave and transition back). Ended up renting a Symphony and using that, paying out of pocket. Feeding a preemie was already difficult enough and the Symphony was the only one that would work.
