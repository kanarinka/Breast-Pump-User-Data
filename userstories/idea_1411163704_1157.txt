Hackathon Engineers/Designers -
 
I’m a breastpump user and I found this email on the Hackathon website, to submit ideas and suggestions for how pumps could be better! I’m obviously now sure how to make most of these things work, but here is my list of ideas. :)
·        My Pumping Position – it would be great if we could lean back in a chair while pumping! It would be even better if we could lie down while doing it! I know this would be amazing for middle-of-the-night pumps.
·        Fog/Condensation – the parts get foggy after just a few minutes of pumping and sometimes it’s so much that I can’t see through so I don’t know if I’m still getting any expressed or not.
·        Parts – I wish the parts were easier to clean! I have to use a bottle brush to get in there, but I can’t get anything (other than water) in the vertical section to clean. Also, why are there threads on the parts where the tubing goes in?! When I'm in a hurry, it never fails, I try to screw my collection bottles onto THAT section on accident! Why are those threads even there?!
·        The Pump Bag – I wish the bag had a retractable cord! It would be SO much easier. At work, I have to disassemble everything each time and reassemble the next time, so the space is ready for the next user. My power cord is a tangled up mess already!
·        The Pump Bag – I wish there were specific compartments for storing certain items. For example, I wish there was a certain pocket for the tubing. As it is, I have to coil the tubing and put it under my flanges. If my flanges are still drying from being cleaned, I put a paper towel down to TRY to keep the water off the tubing. Is retractable tubing an option?! That would be amazing. I would also love certain spots or pockets to keep freezer storage bags, a sharpie, a hands-free bra, etc. Right now, everything just piles up on top of each other in one big slot in my bag. A slot for a laptop would be amazing.
·        A Timer – a timer on the pump somehow would be helpful. Maybe in a spot where you could CHOOSE to see a countdown or not... I know for some, a clock would make things worse.
·        Counterweighted Bottles – during disassembly, the flanges are very easy to knock and it’s knocks the whole bottle over!
·        Noise – I would love if it weren’t so loud!
·        Bottles – on the collection bottles, I would love to see oz. labeled on at least 2 sides. Markings all the way around would be great! (The markings also need to be in color... I have 4 bottles that are totally clear so the markings are just raised plastic. I can't read those at all once they're full!) Also, I feel like more than 4 collection bottles should come with every pump. Sure, I only bring 4 with me to work every day (because that's all the fits in the cooler) but I could see where people would use 6 if they could. I own 12 collection bottles and have had times when I didn't have 4 clean to take to work with me the next day!
 
Thanks for trying to make pumps (and our daily lives) better! I only wish this were happening in a timeframe where I could use the results if any changes are able to happen!
