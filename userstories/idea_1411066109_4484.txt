Too many little parts! When I was pumping, it was a daily cause of concern that a $2 piece of plastic had the ability to ruin an entire day. The little valves got lost, they ripped, and the clear pieces blended in with everything, so those got lost, too. 

There should be a way to avoid dripping - when I would detach the bottle from the breast pieces, I would inevitably get milk all over myself. 

Lighter weight and/or stable enough to put on a lap. I worked in a job that took me all over the city, and it was heavy and inconvenient, and there was no good way to pump in public restrooms, though I certainly did plenty of that. 

Thank you for doing this. I hated pumping so so so much, and I did it for two babies for almost a year each and cursed the machine the whole time!
