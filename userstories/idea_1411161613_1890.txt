What a cool idea!  I look forward to following your work.

Here are a few things I'd like to change about the breast pump:

1) They are so ding-dang loud.  Every breast pump has a special "word" that is says, and the pumper hears it over and over for the duration of the time that they use it.  A quieter pump would be a huge improvement

2) Have flanges that are in colors.  A lactation consultant once said to me that watching yourself pump is like watching a tea-cup and waiting for it to boil.  So non-clear flanges would be an improvement

3) Make sure women can be mobile with it.  I know there are some out there, but being able to move around when you are pumping is hugely enormously helpful

Looking forward to seeing what happens in September!
