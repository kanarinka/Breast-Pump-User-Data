I have a Tommee tippee pump and love it because the actual bottle screws into it. I preferred the Tommee tippee bottles because they were shorter than other bottles which made pumping for 30 minutes easier.

The pump did "walk" across the table when turned on and was quite loud due to the vibration of the pump but when I put a thick mouse pad under it that solved the walking and reduced the nose.

I like the idea of the new pump that you can pump directly into bags but I produced unevenly so that was not ideal. Bags weren't ideal either because it was hard to tell how much exactly was in the bag, they usually leaked and defrosting was a pain. 

I love the pump I have because it is small and easy to travel with. The hospital pump was great because of the strength but too heavy and bulky to take from home to work everyday. 

Improvements I would make would be size of the unit making it easy to trave with and all parts necessary, the strength of the pumping and the noise/"walking" caused by the vibrations made when turned on.
