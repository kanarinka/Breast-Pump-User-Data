Can we come up with a method that uses compression and extending the nipple like a baby does. If so, that could render a lot of the rest of these suggestions less important. -Make flanges out of a fleshy-material that isn\'t cold. Maybe sticky silicone that will mold to the shape of each individual boob. People can buy different sizes for smaller or larger boobs. And it would be great if these flanges/silicone adhesives could somehow apply massaging pressure. Although, if not, it would still be an improvement to have a soft flange so that we can massage with our hands while pumping. When I massage while pumping with my plastic flanges, I often lose the suction on my flange and ruin the pump\'s ""latch"". But if the flanges were soft and ""sticky"" and I could massage on top of them, that\'d be great! -I use the Freemie collection cups now, and they are a HUGE improvement. If we could come up with a collection system that can be concealable like that, but actually concealable instead of making you look like Madonna. -It would be great to have specialized pumps since one pump probably can\'t do it all. One pump for concealment that is small, but the downside is it doesn\'t hold much, or something like that. And one pump that can pump while you lie down and the milk will drain to a reservoir and be chilled there, so that you can go to sleep and not worry about it. A timer on that pump would be great so that it shuts off after 20-30 minutes or something. But that pump would probably be huge, but that would be okay since you\'re lying down and not mobile. -It would be great to have suction/speed controls for each boob instead of them having to be the same. -A quieter pump. -Maybe if the pump parts that attached to the boobs could be made into a bra that you could wear all day that you just plug some tubes into when you have to pump, that would be great.

For women using pumps to increase or stimulate milk production they pump even when milk is not being expressed because they are using the pump to tell the breasts to produce more milk. Conversely other women who have adequate milk supply the pump to collect their milk. Women with low supply need to know how long to leave the pump on for optimal breast stimulation so a timer could help in this regard. Women with adequate supply turn off the pump when milk stops being expressed so they wouldn't need a timer to tell them to turn off the pump, but a timer could be helpful to them for other reasons.

This way a woman could be wearing the device under her loose fitting clothes and the milk bags could be hidden under the clothes on a kind of belt/ or thin vest. The milk bags should rest either under the arms on the side or just below the breast on the stomach.\r\n', '- The motor of the pump needs to be SILENT (Noise canceling technology). The motor needs to be small enough or flat enough so that it can be held withing this belt or vest like piece of clothing along with the milk bags.\r\n', '- The motor should be a plug in rechargeable motor, but have an option for battery use as well (this would have been nice to have during Sandy in case the electricity goes out or you are traveling).\r\n', '- There should be a timer so that it self regulates throughout the day or night without needing to step out of your routine or wake up.

When we have babies who have tongue ties we explain to the mothers that the problem is that the baby extracts the milk using a rhythmic motion with their tongue and that if it can't extend fully then it won't milk the breast efficiently. So a pump should do this too. The suction should not extract the milk - it should be just enough to create a seal (as the baby does).

To encourage a letdown the artificial tongue should also be warm and possibly moist as well as soft (perhaps made of silicone). \r\n"", '\r\n', 'Everything else, like a quieter motor, is just window dressing.

That works okay for a lot of women, but a baby (well, not a newborn, but a baby who knows what it's doing and isn't terrible at breastfeeding) is always significantly faster/gets a lot more milk out than a pump.  And there are still women for whom a pump does nothing.\r\n"", '\r\n', ""I'm picturing, instead of those firm plastic shields, something more like a balloon.  Still a cup shape, but made of pockets that could inflate and deflate rhythmically, to better mimic the motion that a baby's mouth and tongue make when nursing.  It would have to fit pretty well over the breast, and there's the problem of breasts deflating as the milk is expressed to deal with, and I don't know how to resolve that--but that's why I'm sending the idea to you, rather than fashioning my own breastpump!  \r\n"", '\r\n', ""I think the main problem with pumping is that it takes so long for so many women, and it can be extremely discouraging.  You just can't take a thirty minute break every two hours to pump! My 18 month old can empty a painfully full breast in under ten minutes, often five.  A pump takes half an hour to empty a full breast, and the breast never, never gets as empty.  If you can make it faster by making the actual sucking mechanism more similar to a baby's mouth, it could not just make pumping more convenient for working women, but make it possible where before it was impossible.  \r\n"", '\r\n', 'This is a great mission, though, and I was super excited to read about it!']"

I recently returned to work, and while I'm grateful to have the option to pump so I don't need to resort to formula, there have been some frustrations.  Some of which, a pump won't be able to fix (i.e. needing to pump in the storage closet without a lock, and thereby needing to barricade the door), but other things I think could be improved with better breast pump design.  So here are some of the suggestions that, if feasible, I think would make pumping a better experience for me.\r\n"", '\r\n', ""1) Redesign the whole motion for extracting breast milk.  Would it be possible to create a pump that mimic's a baby's mouth movements on the breast rather than feeling like I'm holding a vacuum cleaner up to my nipple?  In my head, something with soft plastic (Maybe with some sort of moistened/lubricated material?) and using a mechanism more similar to a massage chair to mimic the baby's tongue combined with the suction.\r\n"", '\r\n', '2) Rather than messing with those storage bottles at all, what if the milk was directly extracted through a tube that led to a storing tank?  This saves on parts to clean during the day, and lets storage bottles just be used for storing.  It also gets rid of the shifting milk from bottle to bottle to make sure you have two clean bottles for pumping next time.\r\n', '\r\n', ""3) Could some sort of a self-cleaning mechanism be added?  I have the privacy of a storage closet for pumping, but then I need to roam the halls with my breastpump gear to get to the teacher's lounge and clean it (The bathroom just seems so unsanitary!).  And of course, then I always hope there are no male coworkers in the room, as they tend to turn a little red in the face at any sign of pumping gear.\r\n"", '\r\n', ""4) It would be great if a design could be created where you could pump, and cover yourself back up with your shirt... even if your typical shirt isn't a Pancho.  Like I said, storage closet, no lock... occasionally I've had people come in not realizing what it was in use for.  It'd be great if I could be completely covered so that even if they knew what I was doing, nothing would actually be seen.\r\n"", '\r\n', '5) Having the breastpump collect data and give feedback to moms about things like times of day she typically produces the most milk, and keeping track of how much she needs to pump in a day.  Perhaps allowing her to set a goal based on how much her baby is typically consuming while at daycare, and giving reminders of when to pump?\r\n', '\r\n', '6) I want to second many of the ideas that were listed in the article such as longer cords (Or a cordless, rechargable system with good battery life), quieter motor, more customizable flanges, and hands free options without needing to buy additional gear. Especially in light of breastpumps being covered by insurance now, it would be nice to not need to spend lots of extra money on a hands-free bra, extra bottles, the appropriate flange, etc which are all nearly essential to pumping in the workplace.\r\n', '\r\n', ""I really appreciate what you're working on, and hope to see the latest and greatest breastpump out before my husband and I decide to have Baby #2!""]"

The difficulties of pumping at work and the inconvenience of the current pumping technology greatly influence a woman's decision to continue to breastfeed.  According to the Centers for Disease Control 77% of mothers in the USA initiate breastfeeding, yet only 16.4% are exclusively breastfeeding by 6 months (49% still breastfeed at 6 months but not exclusively). According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics 70.5 % of all mothers with children under 18 work and 57.7% of mothers with children under the age of 1 work.

I am a family doctor and work at various office settings and urgent cares. The first challenge was informing the different office managers that I needed a place to pump; uncomfortable conversations ensued with people that didn't face this kind of request very often. I was lucky to have very nice and cooperative employers that allowed me to use patient rooms or offices to pump, but I am sure many women deal with less cooperative management.\r\n"", ""The second challenge was transporting all the equipment; I had to carry my purse, lunch box and the heavy pump bag with all the tubing, cups, diaphragm membranes, cooler, etc. The weight and bulk made it hard to move and I can't imagine commuting on public transport with all that cargo.\r\n"", "" The third challenge was finding a time and place to pump. In the rush of urgent care, primary care medicine, and integrative medicine, time was hard to come by.  I had 30-60 minutes for lunch, which I had to allocate for completing patient notes, lunch, and pumping.  I didn't automatically get pump breaks in the patient schedule, so beyond what was allocated for lunch time, pump time required further bargaining. Appointments were back to back, and often visits required more time than expected. In this scenario I had to find a private room with a lockable door, to avoid any breast pump flashing, then pull out the device, plug it in, hook up and turn on the machine for a total prep and pump time of about 20 min. This needs to be repeated every few hours and can cause havoc on your schedule.\r\n"", 'The fourth challenge was keeping together, functional and clean all the equipment required for pumping.

I would be able to pump at my desk, with the door open. It would hook up to my car so I could pump while commuting.

Then I have a dirty bag that I throw the used parts into after I'm done, because I don't have a sink where I am pumping, and I don't want to spend time wiping etc.  (I have two sets of parts so I can pump twice without taking time at work to wash.)  I rinse out the dirty bag at night so I can reuse it, but after a while it becomes pretty gross - found mold in one once.  Anyway, I would love a nice, compact, plastic washable box that specifically fits the parts and is easy to clean.  I could wash it along with the parts every night.  Would seriously love that.\r\n"", ""Alternatively, with my last baby, I had a mini fridge of my own in my office, so I would just put the parts in the fridge so that I could use them again later in the day without washing.  (I would always get a cup of tea before to the second pumping session, and hold the cold flanges over it to warm them up before sticking them on...)  But in my new office, I only have access to our shared fridge, so as much as I'm open about the fact that I'm pumping, I don't think my coworkers need to actually see pump parts in a plastic bag next to their lunch.  So an opaque box would again be awesome.\r\n"", '\r\n', '- I find that squeezing / massaging each breast while pumping, especially towards the end, really helps both speed things up and get the last bit out that might not have otherwise come out with just the pump.

I exclusively breastfeed my three month old son and recently returned to work.  I will be relying on my pump to meet my goal (and the generally accepted medical advice) to breastfeed my child until he is a year old.  I have lots of complaints but few ideas on how to solve them - but I figure that is what all of you smart people are getting together for!  For your referene, I have a Hygeia Q (apparently only available to women who are getting their breast pump through their insurance), which I got in May of this year.  So in no particular order:\r\n', ' \r\n', ""I saw a Facebook post from someone named Jessica Jackson Shortall who noted that the flanges stick straigh out from the body, requiring the user to lean forward to keep milk from collecting in the flange.  She's right.  There are several problems with this.  One is that milk leaks out from around the flange, sometimes splashing me in the face, sometimes getting on my clothes, and making a general mess.  Breastmilk is sticky, and when you're trying to work in an office/professional environment, you don't want big wet spots of breastmilk all over your clothes. \r\n"", ' \r\n', ""Another problem with milk collecting in the flanges is that it's hard to see whether milk is still coming out of the breast.  There's milk swishing around and it's hard to tell where it's coming from.  Another thing that makes it hard to see whether milk is still coming out is that condensation forms inside the flanges and bottles, just generally making it hard to see what's going on.\r\n"", ' \r\n', 'A related problem to milk leaking out of the flanges is that I find I need to press them hard into my breast, both to stop milk from leaking out and just to maintain suction.  This can cause clogged ducts, which can lead to mastitis or worse.\r\n', ' \r\n', ""As many people have probably noted, my pump is also very loud.  I don't want to pump in my office because the walls are thin and I don't really want people picturing what I'm doing in here when they hear the pump.  And when I do it at home, for some reason the sound is like nails on a chalkboard for my husband.\r\n"", ' \r\n', 'My pump uses something they refer to as ""duckbills"" in the flanges - milk goes through them into the bottle.  They seem really flimsy, and I\'m assuming they don\'t work as well if torn.  I just read not to put anything into them, which makes me feel like I won\'t be able to get them really clean.  They\'re also tiny and easy to lose (I dropped one into my garbage disposal and had to fish it out and clean it the best I could, because I only had one pair).  It\'s also hard to find anyone who sells them.\r\n', ' \r\n', ""Related to that story, sanitation is always a concern.  A thorough cleaning takes too long when you're trying to pump in the middle of a busy workday, and I just can't imagine that using the wipes created to clean them, or storing the parts in the fridge, is really a 100% sufficient way to make sure uneccessary bacteria isn't getting into the milk that could cause it to prematurely spoil.\r\n"", ' \r\n', ""An obvious problem that's come up throughout my comments above is just how long pumping takes. \r\n"", ' \r\n', ""Another problem that just seems to be a basic assumption of pumping is that it won't empty the breast as thoroughly as the baby.  Again, one of the problems with this is that clogged ducts or reduced supply can result from a failure to thoroughly empty the breast.  My son drinks 4 ounce bottles, when I saw a lactation consultant we determined that he gets 4 ounces when he breastfeeds directly from me (just from one side), yet when I pump just one side, I can't get 4 ounces.\r\n"", ' \r\n', 'A problem that I experienced just yesterday is how easy it is to spill breastmilk while trying to detach from the pump and transfer to a storage container.  I was storing the milk directly in the bottles I was pumping into, but I noticed that the fat was collecting at the top and sticking to the side of the bottle.  That fat is important for the baby to get, and it was going to waste unless I poured the milk into a bag as soon as I was done pumping.  And yesterday, before I could close the bag, I knocked it over and spilled half the milk I had just spent so much time away from my desk to pump.\r\n', ' \r\n', ""I also don't understand why there seems to be such a lack of interchangeability between different brands of pumps.  This makes the parts expensive and hard to find.\r\n"", ' \r\n', ""Finally, we have the issue of cost.  Luckily, I received my pump at no cost to me through my insurance.  But I recenlty spent $100 on spare parts.  And obviously someone is paying for these pumps.  The ones I see on sale at stores are $250 - $300.  Why do they have to cost so much?  Laptops, with all their computing technology, can run as little as $300.  It seems that something the size of a breastpump that doesn't have to add, spellcheck, search the internet, etc, and that's made of plastic, should cost less than a computer.\r\n"", ' \r\n', 'Thank you all for putting on this event and spending time thinking about this item that helps so many babies and moms!

For a minute or two, most mom\'s could probably get just as much, if not more milk, by hand expression... but hands get tired quickly.

There was an attachment that you could put on the bottles and on your bra and then an additional attachment to actually hold the bottles to your body and not have to use your hands to hold them. I will say I really hardly ever used that because it didn't work very well and it was cumbersome. The manual will tell you basically that you can use it so that you have her hands free to read a book or something.realistically I need my hands free to cook to fold laundry or to manage my own children.

It is hard to make sure that you're filling it to the right capacity and then when you actually freeze it you have to freeze it straight up and down if you lay it on its side at times it will cause a problem in the freezing. Even if you do everything right you can still thaw out the milk and there's some kind of leak. for example if the plastic touches another item in the freezer and when you pull it away causes a small tear that you wouldn't notice until the milk thaws and it starts leaking. This is even worse when you thaw it in warm water and then all the milk is contaminated. If you thaw it in your refrigerator inside a bowl or something plastic to catch any leaked milk then you can save some of the milk. so the issue with this is if you have a babysitter or nanny or daycare who is thawing frozen milk for the baby and then can't use it because of some freezing issue and bags you know your baby doesn't have any food which is super devastating  as a mom of an infant.\r\n"", '\r\n', 'in addition to those issues, it is a pain to freeze and store little baggies of milk straight up and down not touching anything.

It's just another step and I don't understand why it can't be more seamless and of course a better design rather than having literally a bottle hanging off your two breasts or a bag hanging off your breasts why can't it attach to a tube and go to a more discreet location. The Baggies that are attached directly,  I like that it's pumping directly into them. There are couple issues though. So the bags hold five ounces but typically you're not pumping a full 5 ounces. For me I try to get the 5 ounces every time so I'm not buying more and more bags and again the whole issue with freezing and making sure that I have enough room in my freezer for all of it.\r\n"", ""the design is such that getting the bag on the attachments and off the attachment is a little tricky. Getting it on is fine but getting it off can become a problem because you have the milk in there and you don't want to spill it out. In addition to that you have to close the bag and you have to empty all the air out of the bag so that it freezes properly. Some of them have double seals to make it secure. All of it is cumbersome and stressful and you never know if you're doing it right. And it doesn't make sense. \r\n"", '\r\n', ""so that's nice feedback.

Maybe the tubing drains into a bag (that's can't leak) and since breastmilk can stay out 5 hours, it gives you quite a long time before you'd have to change the bag out. Just make it easy to change the bag without having to undress! It would also be great for moms who exclusively pump!!

Obviously that\xe2\x80\x99s a more global cultural change than just the technology (or the experience) of pumping, but I think there are lots of ways that improving the efficiency and ease of pumping could help moms to feel less stressed about fitting it into the workday, while making it so that other staff barely notice the interruption.\r\n', ' \r\n', 'My two cents: as a manager who interacts a lot with the public as well as high-level elected officials, I found it very challenging to dress myself formally while also being able to \xe2\x80\x9cdisrobe\xe2\x80\x9d in order to pump quickly and without making a mess via spilled milk or cleaning the pump. I always felt like there are so many options for maternity wear, yet \xe2\x80\x9cnursing clothes\xe2\x80\x9d are often ill-suited to pumping, and so-called career clothes are very non-pumping friendly. There has to be a way to work new clothing construction, or fabric that\xe2\x80\x99s easier to clean, into the attire options for professional women who need pump (aka, the type of people most likely to be in a position to breastfeed and pump in the first place). I spent a fortune drycleaning stuff after spilling milk, cleaner, or getting makeup on myself while trying to get dressed and undressed. Not to mention how awful it is to sit half naked in your office with nothing but a pumping bra on! I also found that the higher-end pumps really do require significant dissembling and hand washing in order to function at top speed, and there has GOT to be a better \xe2\x80\x9cquick clean\xe2\x80\x9d option out there than the filmy wipes or microwave steamers currently available. Better yet: a self-cleaning pump? If that existed, women could set it and forget it, and potentially fit in more pumping sessions during the day to keep up with their baby\xe2\x80\x99s needs! Cleaning the darn thing was half the battle some days. \r\n', 'Secondly, I wish the pumps could work quicker, and come with a lot more flange sizes, a bra/holder, extra bottles, etc. yes, your insurance may cover a pump, but (at least in my experience) it\xe2\x80\x99s not likely to be the kind of fast double-expression one you see in the hospitals, and those accessories that are so essential to pumping success really do add up.

The bottle is bulky, and you have to have two of them- so you definitely can\'t wear a shirt over it. It also becomes more likely to spill, slop, and interfere with the little flap-thing at the top of the bottle as they fill up. For someone like me who had small breasts but a very big supply, this was a really huge problem. It makes the breast flange press and shift and spontaneously ""pop off"" (making a MESS), your bra/pants/clothing get splattered if you overfill the bottle before noticing the problem, it necessitates swapping out multiple bottles per breast in a single session (which is wasteful in time, effort, and space).\r\n', '\r\n', 'Instead the milk should go through collection tubes with a little bit of negative air pressure and get sucked into a separate refrigerated bottle housed next to (or near) the pumping motor. As the milk is pulled through the line into the new (imaginary) storage bottle, it could even be flash-cooled still in the tubing to lower the chance of bacterial growth. This would fix the weight-of-bottle issue, the overfilled bottle issue, the mess issue, the interfered flap issue, and the ""can\'t wear clothing while pumping"" issue because it would make the profile of the parts on the breast so much more streamlined. It would also almost solve the problem of allowing for pumping lying down because the negative air pressure in the tube would greatly aid the gravity problem (although the lying down thing would still have other kinks to solve).\r\n', '\r\n', ""This adds more tubes and more washing, so that's a downside. Not sure how to conquer that part. I leave it to your hack-a-thoners. Good luck. I hope this suggestion is helpful. I know I would have LOVED this sort of system for pumping for both of my kids.

I had days where I thought I was going to explode!  Missing pumping sessions drastically reduced my milk supply, and frustrated my daughter when she tried to nurse.

Companies are slow to respond to nursing moms, when it is either male leadership in the way, or female leadership who chose not have to nurse their infant, or have not yet experienced parenthood.  There is a lack of understanding, or an unwillingness to understand.  Presenting the statistics of how beneficial nursing is for a child, just does not seem to connect with business leaders.  Even when we presented the long term financial savings, and healthcare costs, it did not spark interest.  Business leaders are trained to think of the immediate bottom line.

However, from experience, the breast cups would perform better if they were made from a thinner more flexible rubber/ plastic that covered the nipple, areola, and another 2-3 inches of breast (depending on your size).  One designer, if I recall correctly, added small bubbles on the cup to add more pressure points, like a massage effect.  The problem with that design, was that the bubbles were along the outer breast tissue area, not around the areola.  This is where the most stimulation must occur.   A much smaller ripple or bubble effect of the breast cup where it contacts the outer areola and nipple would be best.  In addition, I would encourage the development of a thinner pliable material that could remain on, with a connector to the tubing and pump below the nipple area, to limit the time it would take to set up.  This would require a material that could be worn against the breast tissue for longer periods.   One could simply attach the double channeled tubing (milk flow extraction and valved suction to pull milk into the receptacle), and start pumping.   Additional lighting on the pump itself, may help in poorly lit environments.\r\n', '\r\n', 'Challenges facing these design ideas are how to clean the tubing, materials to withstand multiple uses, overall sanitation issues, and suction control, and reducing skin friction around the nipple and areola.       \r\n', '\r\n', 'Although a more refined device is needed, one still needs a place to put it.  Just as there are baby change tables in the bathroom, can we create a pumping station?

Although not ideal, it may be a place to start, to begin to bring breastfeeding to the everyday, and help remove the mystery and shock value.  It may be easier to convince congress to insist upon breastfeeding amenities just as those for handicapped persons, if they can be easily incorporated into existing infrastructure. \r\n', '\r\n', 'If a private stall were to be deemed acceptable, sanitary, and provide the necessary amenities, it should include:\r\n', 'enclosed and private, with a locking door, floor to ceiling walls\r\n', 'must be separated by a floor to ceiling wall from the nearest commode\r\n', 'supplied with sanitary wipes to ensure cleanliness between uses\r\n', 'a comfortable chair with wipe down surfaces\r\n', 'a tray table large enough to hold the pump\r\n', 'standard ground electrical outlet within 12\xe2\x80\x9d of the table\r\n', 'a second shelf or tray table to support the milk containers\r\n', 'good lighting\r\n', 'nonslip flooring\r\n', 'separate sink and hand towel/ hand dryer\r\n', 'mandatory posting of information on the benefits of breastfeeding, troubleshooting tips, and a hotline for assistance such as the local La Leche League or other organization that supports breastfeeding moms.\r\n', '\r\n', 'Although this is not an ideal scenario, again it is likely a solid first step.

Challenges to this type  of approach are the schedules and work patterns of healthcare and retail employees.  These employees are not structured around flexible projects and meetings.

Is there a way for the carrying case to also include space for parts (bottles, bags, flanges, etc.)? I end up tossing all of the various parts into a ziplock bag and then toss this, along with my pumping bra, the pump, and tubes into a separate small duffel. When it's all put together for travel, it's bulky and awkward. \r\n"", ""3) The incessant chant of the pump is enough to drive sleep-deprived moms crazy.

I have a dial on my pump that is marked by dots and the dial knob has no arrow. I have no idea of the ""level"" at which I usually pump. (Just look at the dial on the In Style. What the heck?) So, when I turn the knob, I am guessing at which ""strength"" my little friend is working.\r\n', '5) For some moms, a mechanism that allows them to keep track of when they pumped, which breast(s) they pumped, and how much they pumped would come in handy.

However, having 4 lengths of tubing will make it very difficult unless you have an inexpensive cleaning system that could emulate the process I use at the office.  You could present it as a countertop box that can flush and clean parts automatically.  You would then have 4 lengths of tubing and 2 nipple shields.  If they remain connected, you would only need 2 inputs/2 outputs.  When we need to lubricate handpieces in large quantity, we hook them onto a coupler and the lubricant shoots through and flushes them out.

First I think the flanges need to be more rubber and expandable. Every woman does not fit into the perfect nipple size....really? average nipple size? You have such an array of woman and breast sizes, that 24 almost never fits anyone perfect. We need a rubber flange that can really adjust to mom and how her breasts fit. Secondly, we need a pump that doesn't make so much noise!!! That sound, and I think every pumping mom will agree, is so annoying, You feel like a pumped cow!

If the part that hugs the breast were soft and did not have plastic-y surface, it would cause less irritation to the skin of the breast and you could pump more efficiently because you can help manually (as is, with the plastic flange, when you help manually you are only able to touch the upper parts of the breast).
