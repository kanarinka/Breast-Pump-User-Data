The flanges/breast sheilds need some major overhall. There's sizing issues (I'm between sizes) and if they were made out of a softer or more flexible material would be better. Being able to pump without the parts sticking out 5 or more inches from your chest, and being able to lay down or sit comfortably would be so much better!
