Hi There.
 
I’ve logged over 40,000 airline miles this year all while pumping 4x a day on both sides and I hate traveling and pumping because it’s inconvenient and difficult to stay sanitary.
 
Frustrations:
-          The pump takes up half my suitcase, it’s that big

-          I bring an extra insulated lunch bag with blocks of ice and even an empty Ziploc to fill with cubed ice once I get to the airport (post security) to keep the milk cold. If I’m gone for 2 days I usually come back with over 45 ounces of milk in pump & store bags

-          I can’t wash the pump case. The pump has been with me in construction sites, airport bathrooms, cars, conference rooms, suitcases, hotels, restaurants and more. I’m so disgusted by the outside of my case that I wish I could wash it.

-          The tubing for whatever reason collects moisture and eventually molds. I have had to replace often

-          I never realized how often I would need to pump without available power (conf rooms, electrical outages from storms, airports, cars) and the battery powered pack has saved me

-          If your milk supply is low, the cones have a hard time staying on and makes pumping from both sides difficult

-          I always empty one side before the other, so when dual pumping I have to disconnect the side that is finished and manually hold the tubing air supply so the other side can continue pumping

-          Every time I pass through TSA my pump has to get swiped. Not sure how to improve that.

Hopefully sharing these challenges helps. Thank you for taking the time to hack the breast pumps!
