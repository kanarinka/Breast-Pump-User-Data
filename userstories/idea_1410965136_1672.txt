I want to pump lying down
I want to wash fewer pieces 
I don't want to have to replace membranes
I want to pump in silence, or to be able to watch Tv without having to turn the volume up
I want soft pieces against my skin, not hard plastic, that loses suction if I shift my position
I want to pump into containers that are at the same time either useable store-able
