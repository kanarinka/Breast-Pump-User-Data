1. Have the milk extracted by two low profile 'suction pads' that sit inside a regular or nursing bra and flow the milk out to tubes. These can be worn invisibly under clothing so that pumping can be done discretely in public if necessary.

2. The milk goes via the tubes directly into milk storage bags that can be placed in the fridge or freezer, or poured into a bottle. 

3. Alternatively, the milk goes into a silicone receptor on top of each of these 'suction pads'. These receptors follow the shape of the breast so that the only shape difference is that you appear to be wearing a very padded bra. Anything that gets rid of the hard to clean tubes would be appreciated!) Difficult to describe, but could draw up the idea if you are interested. 

4. The breast pump motor includes a cellphone-like battery that can be charged via usb or power while on the go.

5. All parts are dishwasher safe.

6. If a noise is necessary, it is a low white noise continual hum rather than a pumping noise.

7. Many babies only take one breast per feed. Can there be an option that makes it easy to be feeding your baby from one breast at the same time as pumping from the other?

8. Many parents purchase white noise machines. The breast pump (if it needs to emit a sound) could produce a white noise, so that while not in use it still has a use in the nursery and after women have stopped pumping.

9. The pump displays how much milk has been collected in each receptor in millilitres and ounces.

10. The pump records the time of day and amount collected in an intelligent way so that you can see patterns and gage when you collect the most milk and when is the best time to pump for you.

Happy to contribute more ideas and be part of the process! I am an advertising creative for my day job, but at the moment a full-time mom to a 11 week old baby. I am from New Zealand, but currently living in San Francisco.
