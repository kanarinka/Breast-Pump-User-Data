I can't say I have a ton of ideas on how to make it better but I can share with you the suckitude stuff about it. 

#1 cleaning the pump parts really sucks. There are so many tiny crevices and pieces that are hard to get to and you need to clean it well. Every. Single. Time. So that was like every 2 hours for several months which really sucked. 

#2 I liked the let down function and the fact that you can set it for different strengths but it still seems to take forever! 

#3 it's really hard to scroll through pictures of your baby while you got 2 hands on the pumps. Looking at pictures and videos really helps with let down but there's got to be a better way to get that going along with the pump do my hands can stay on the pumps. 

#4 hands free would be nice if I didn't have to pull out something that resembles a corset with holes. That's just not going to work for me. I don't want to wear it all the time and I don't want to get completely undressed every time I pump. 

#5 power source. I mean really. Do you know how hard it is to find a private place with a plug in an amusement park, hotel, restaurant etc. not easy. They do not put many plugs in bathroom stalls and yuck to pumping in a bathroom anyway. Solar cells maybe? I do not want to rely on 8 aa batteries for my comfort or child's nourishment. 

Thanks for listening, hope that helps!
