The features of a hospital grade pump (like the Medela symphony) in a less expensive, more portable pump. My body has a limited response to traditional double electric pumps and renting a Medela Symphony is the only way I am able to pump at work and provide breastplate exclusively.  I pump in less time and get more output. However it is way to pricey to purchase and it is large (carrying it back and forth to work. The case is a hard platic case with no room to store my other supplies).
