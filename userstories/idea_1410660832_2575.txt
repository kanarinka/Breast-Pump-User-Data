Testing on the way infants suck on a nipple so pumps can better imitate a baby's suction might help the mothers who have trouble using pumps because their milk flow is not the same when using a pump compared to their child.
I started pumping when my daughter was 2 weeks old, but couldn't "trick" my body to get the same milk flow when I was pumping.
