I don't know if this helps, but I can bring on let-down more easily if I lean forward so that they cups I'm using are literally underneath my breasts and my breasts are hanging down. I couldn't ever do this before I had the Freemie collection cups or milk would've spilled out, but I did it coincidentally once while pumping to pick up something off the ground and noticed a change in feel/efficiency. There's something about the breasts hanging down and the suction of the Freemie cups pulling on my nipple in that way that nearly immediately brings on a let-down. I just figured I'd send on the tip in the event it is helpful to figuring out the mechanics of what will work better!
