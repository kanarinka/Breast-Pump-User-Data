 Hello.  I am a registered nurse and have been pumping for 28 months.  I have used manual, electric, and hospital-grade pumps.  I have the following feedback for you:
 
--Electric pumps have either a single or double atachment for the hoses...this could be made standard across all pumps or a two-to-one attachment can be made available.  Very important when switching between multiple pumps of different brands.  With an attachment, you wouldn't have to use multiple sets of supplies - only one set could be used and washed per day.
 
--Make flanges available to buy one at a time.  Left and right breasts are often different sizes and -require different flange size.
 
--Make an attachment to enable pumping from both breasts into one single bottle.  This would save a lot of bottle/cap washing and pouring and consdensing, etc.  (Note: you can't pour freshly pumped milk into a cold bottle that you may have pumped earlier).
 
--The largest part of the flange (touching the skin) is hard plastic.  When the slightest movement is made, the suction is broken, making it embarassing to hand compress while in public.  This interrupts pumping and makes a "fart-like" noise.  Perhaps make a silicone rim or an air-filled perimeter (similar to an ambu-bag used to deliver breaths during CPR) or make the entire "cone" more flexible.
 
--The inside of the flange (at the point where it begins to form the narrow tube) can be a rough and abrupt transition, especially on Ameda brand where there is an opening above.  It has been known to cause scrapes/bleeding.
 
--I hope this is useful.  Feel free to contact me anytime for further comments/information!
