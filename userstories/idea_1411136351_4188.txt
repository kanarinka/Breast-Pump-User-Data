Great initiative! Pumping needs to be faster and more discrete:

(1) Pump Motor: able to drain breasts in 5 mins instead of 15 mins
(2) Pump motor: silent
(3) Milk storage: collect milk beside pump rather than in front of breasts - more discrete, allows mom to keep shirt on and feel less like a cow
(4) Pump Bra: design a bra for full day wear with built in breast shells so mom can connect tubing to shells without removing shirt and/or bra
(5) Policy: work places should supply a hospital grade pump in the designated "pump room" so moms do not have to carry pump to/from work
