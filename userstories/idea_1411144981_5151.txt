Friend of mine shared this on her Facebook page and my initial response to the title "Make the Breast Pump Not Suck" was "Dear Lord YES please!"  As a first time mom I was so earnest to breastfeed for the first year.  After 2 months I had to go back to work and for the life of me I could not get three- yes three!- different breast pumps to work.  I would sob knowing what the consequences were.  After much advise I tried and tried to get them to work but alas no such luck.  I was really shocked at how the pump didn't have much of a suction strength at all.  I had large breasts to begin with and once they were engorged, I found that the pulling action was next to nothing and didn't come close to my son's strength.  Also, could you work on reducing the cost?  Despite the fact that we had the "top of the line" most expensive one- I don't see what this equipment is so very expensive.  It breaks my heart to think of the mother's out there who cannot afford the best and then give up too.  I wish you all the best of luck on this project and know there are many of us who are so excited to see what you guys do! Thank you!
