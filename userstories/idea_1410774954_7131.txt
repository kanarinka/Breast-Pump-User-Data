Pumping should involve individual pump units that don't have any cordage so if I want to walk across the room while pumping I can, so I don't have to worry about the condensation in the plastic tubing, so if I run out of time to pack up my pump while I'm pumping during my planning period (I'm a teacher) then students don't see weird tubes and think I have serious medical concerns! 

Can't I just attach two little, quiet, individual pump units to each side, with no mother (get it?) unit? That would be awesome!!!
