I was very happy to read about your breast pump "hackathon." I have pumped for both of my kids. Here are my wish list items: 

Quieter, so I can be on a phone call while pumping without the other person hearing bizarro noises 
Less obtrusive, so it would be feasible to pump in public (say, at the gate at an airport rather than on the floor in the family restroom, which I've done too many times) without it being super obvious. This would entail the plastic parts being closer to your body so they could fit under a loose shirt. 
Battery packs that don't weigh a ton. Maybe some kind of small chargeable battery that could charge itself when the pump is plugged in? 
It would be AWESOME if you could pump while lying down or moving around.
If anybody is going to actually try to sell these things, make them less ugly. Put it in a bag that's not hideous. 
Thanks for applying your smarts to this!
