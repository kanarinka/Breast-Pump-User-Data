I'm 40, pumping at work 3 days/wk. Have 14 month old preterm twin boys. BF definitely helped them thrive. Pumping sucks for all your reasons plus it hurts, must be careful to buy appropriate size accessories , who knows until you pump, buy 2, 3, sets. also must have correct speed programmed. also must tilt forward regardless of what literature says. Hands free bra sucks, causes mastitis (sp) and lumps. shields leak down breasts - gross, messy. I have used 3 different Medala pumps and had delusions and used hand pump few times. Have to massage pre-pump for better results. Is there an easier solution to refrigeration separately? Different models of pumps accessories do not always fit regardless of manufacturer. Can't it be simplified? Promoting awareness makes you look pretentious, so I slither into storage closet and pump 4 x day. Makes me feel like I'm stealing from my company and coworkers rather than helping my babies. Haul my lunch bag home with milk and freezer packs every day. Pumping is an art and a science. Took me books, blogs, LC's, friends, controlled experiments, and I'm still learning proper methods. Thank you for listening. Diana Sironi 781 223-6369. Text ok.
