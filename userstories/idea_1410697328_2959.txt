I also echo the ideas of something portable that you could pump hands free (for real...) and walk around with either as a backpack or belt. I also want hands free to work for us plus sized gals and those who have DDD and bigger sized boobs! Good luck finding anything on the market now - my friend used a sports bra to make a homemade hands free contraption because she couldn't find one that fit.
Also as a teacher who has to pump at work... It would be nice if the pump could be discreet and easily worn or attached under regular clothing.
Best of luck! Glad this is happening! I live in the metro Boston area if you need Moms who are currently breastfeeding and pumping!
