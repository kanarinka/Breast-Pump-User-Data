Hello! 
I just read the article about your hackathon and, although my relationship with my pump (and it really feels like an intimate relationship!) ended more than a year ago, I wanted to relay a piece of advice I got from a friend before my first baby was born. I could not fathom how these things worked, and she tried to educate me on the mechanics, but what she said about the emotional side of pumping helped equally as much. She said that if possible, it helps to devote your attention to the task at hand, and to spend some time thinking about your baby and looking at pictures of her. This helps with the letdown and oxytocin release. I made it routine when I was at work to pull up a slide show of my daughter on my computer. Perhaps it would be possible to integrate some aspect of the emotional connection to the baby that is so important and tends to be absent in the pumping process.
Thanks and good work!
