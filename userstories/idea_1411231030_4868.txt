It shouldn't hurt! I'm currently suffering with an open sore from my nipple rubbing against the flange 
It shouldn't break your back- leaning over to pump or carrying something heavy sucks
The parts shouldn't stick out so far- it makes it hard to move around 
It should be portable- A backpack might be nice
It should be easy to clean
Replacement parts should be affordable 
Being able to multitask while pumping is a must
