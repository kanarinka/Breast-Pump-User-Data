What I hate most about pumping is taking apart all the components, washing and sterilizing them, letting them air dry, and then putting them back together again the next time I have to pump.  (On my particular pump there are 12 separate parts that need to be cleaned and reassembled.) What would be amazing is a new design that limits contact with the milk to as few parts as possible, reducing the amount of time and energy that is required for cleaning and assembly.  Can you design a pump in which only the container that actually receives the pumped milk needs to be taken apart and sterilized?  Thanks for all your efforts!
