"Hands on pumping" is important. Make a pumping device that doesn't just attach to the nipple/areola but also massages the entire breast in some way....even the area back near the armpit. Sizing would be difficult but maybe there's a way to make "adjustable" equipment.

I am tired of the hard plastic flanges. We need softer material used.
