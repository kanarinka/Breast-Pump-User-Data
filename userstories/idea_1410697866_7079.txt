Now, the bottles. I hate the bottles. Why such a large diameter? And why even larger on other pump brands? It's part of the reason I didn't switch to Hygenia, those giant bottles. Pumping is an irritating activity. Its intended to be, but when the plastic bottles or the plastic tubes rest against my skin it's almost like nails on a chalk board. I have to keep a shirt or blanket between me an the vibrating plastic. Remember I'm doing this for 30min+, 8 times a day. How would you like a back massager on one spot of your body for 30min 8 times per day. Agggh! We need slender or platapus like containers, someone mentioned colostomy bags.
