Make pumps easier to use right out of the box. I was fortunate enough to have a ton of support from a local breastfeeding group when I started pumping, which helped me maximize the amount I was getting. If I had done it on my own, my yield would have been tiny and I may have given up. Thanks so much for doing this!!
