Hello hackers,

Here is my one idea that would be SO easy:

1.  The funnels or flanges that come with the pump should be permanently changed to the PumpinPals funnels/flanges.  It was only after reading a Lucie's List email that my dear husband told me we should order the PumpinPal funnels/flanges so I could sit back and relax while pumping milk.  It has made pumping ENJOYABLE and my breasts don't hurt nearly as bad as they used to with the regular funnels/flanges.  They help the pump suck better.  No pun intended.  I guess it's more of a funnel/flange issue than a pump issue but they make such a huge difference and I don't know why our LC never told us about them!!!  Please please look them up on Amazon.

Can't wait to hear the amazing ideas that come from this hackathon!
