Pumping while reclining or lying down needs to happen.  My back is always sore from the position I have to assume when pumping. 

In addition to being made of hard plastic and at a strange angle, the flanges are always steaming up.  Makes it hard to see what is coming out most of the time. 

Make the nobs on the actual pump more intuitive.  On my Medela PISA, there is a nob that has no printing.  So while there are marks on the box going around the nob. I can't tell how far I've turned the nob unless I'm looking at it super closely (while simultaneously holding the flanges and making sure I don't lean over too far!).
