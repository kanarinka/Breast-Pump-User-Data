Humble suggestions from a working academic mom of 2 kids (6 month and 3 yrs) with a 1+ hour commute each way and regular out of town trips who has breastfed (and pumped) for both kids.
 
My breastpump invention desire... laptop backpack breastpump. Where when you aren’t pumping you can remove said pump and just have a useful bag. And would be great for the pump to be quiet, comfortable and suck the milk directly into a removable internal freezer pack without all the pieces to assemble. And the whole thing needs to be dishwasher safe and weigh less than 2 lbs. And the laptop can tap into the same battery pack as the pump. If it's an extender battery for laptop too you are good to go. Add Bluetooth and it's a sound system too plus it can report charge and flow on computer for later mHealth recording and product marketing which would come back through the speakers unless you pay an extra fee to silence it.
 
 If men had to breastfeed these things would be subsidized and Tesla would offer an in-car pump as an option. So there should also be federal funding to support use of these as a core health care benefit.
 
That’s all.
