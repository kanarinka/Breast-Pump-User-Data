Hi! I'm a master's prepared nurse, and my research focused on breastfeeding. A couple of things moms mentioned to me: 
1) noise. The noise of a pump makes it hard to pump. Put a small led light on it to indicate suction is working, so mom doesn't have to rely on feel or noise.
2) portable power- the weight and unwieldy cord of a really good pump is killer.
3) hygienic conditions- if a mom wants to give her pump away, it needs to be easy to make sure it's clean.
4) Grandma appeal. If the older women around a new mother support breastfeeding, it's more likely to happen. Making the pump economical, or making breastmilk easier to store, or making the pump look modern/fashionable or easy to carry, all help the older women in her life get behind breastfeeding.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR DOING THIS! YOUR WORK WILL HELP MILLIONS!
