I would love an adaptor that let's me use the pump I like with the bottles my daughter prefers. We currently have 3 sets of bottles in our house: the ones that came with the pump (back ups for pumping and storage only) the larger bottles that fit the pump and don't overfill when I empty my breasts (primary for pumping and back ups for feeding), and the ones my daughter prefers to drink from.
