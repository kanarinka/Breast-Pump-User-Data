Why does the pump have to be so far from the breast, connected with those long tubes? Doesn't that tubing reduce the sucking power anyway? What if pumps were small, powerful little motors attached to each boob/flange... or positioned across the sternum of the chest, or worn as a little backpack? One pump per boob would also increase the customization (one boob usually produces more than the other and let down doesn't happen at the same time). One of the things I hated most, even with my Medela freestyle double which fit into the pocket of my bathrobe, was how NOT mobile you are when you're pumping. One of the biggest reasons moms don't pump is time and needing their hands - and if you make the whole experience more mobile, moms get that time back. Also, why do those little vent holes have to be in places where milk easily spills from bottles?  Even if you're lucky enough to have a mobile, double pump and a hands-free bra, you still spill milk if you bend over to actually tend to the child you're pumping for.
