I have a two year old daughter and breast feeding was a nightmare for me. After 2 weeks of trying I turned to pumping until I had to go back to work. I run a personal care company and have thought and talked about this a lot with our R&D department and would love to make this a reality, especially for working and very busy moms who get no sleep or down time.

The overall goal of my ideas is that pumping breast milk should not take time out of what you are already doing day or night because you would rather spend that time feeding your child and being with your child rather that pumping and then feeding your child. 

These are the general ideas that I have voiced:
- The  'suction cup' / breast pad should be made of a malleable hydrophobic silicone/nylon like material so that it can attach to every breast and nipple size. Or a memory foam sponge like material with a water proof malleable exterior so that the milk doesn't leak out.  
- The 'pump pad' should have 'stim like pulsing' shooting from the periphery towards nipple simulating the sucking or massaging motion.
- The 'pump pad' should either be disposable, one time use (and if this is the case, ideally recyclable). Or an adhesive would need to be reapplied with each use in order to make sure that the seal is always tight and milk doesn't leak out the sides. First choice is recyclable 1 time use because cleaning these could be labor intensive as well.
- The strength of the sucking feel should be strong enough to extract milk from any 360 degree angle.
- The pad should be able to fit within a bra and the tubing should either come out of the middle of the breast plate and around and under the breasts, or from the sides and under the armpits down the side of the torso. This way a woman could be wearing the device under her loose fitting clothes and the milk bags could be hidden under the clothes on a kind of belt/ or thin vest. The milk bags should rest either under the arms on the side or just below the breast on the stomach.
- The motor of the pump needs to be SILENT (Noise canceling technology). The motor needs to be small enough or flat enough so that it can be held withing this belt or vest like piece of clothing along with the milk bags.
- The motor should be a plug in rechargeable motor, but have an option for battery use as well (this would have been nice to have during Sandy in case the electricity goes out or you are traveling).
- There should be a timer so that it self regulates throughout the day or night without needing to step out of your routine or wake up. It should be able to function while you are sleeping. 
- There needs to be a silent vibration indicating when a milk bag is full so that it stops sucking and you can change it and put it in the fridge.
- The bags will need to come in multiple sizes so that if a woman produces a lot of milk she doesn't need to constantly keep changing the bags.

I hope that this helps and if anyone would like any further color or ideas around making this commercially viable, please feel free to email me at keechshetty@gmail.com. I would love to make this happen sooner rather than later.
