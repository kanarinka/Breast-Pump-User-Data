THE GOLDEN EGGS - A soft disk-shaped membrane covers the breast, inside are 5 'eggs' arranged around the nipple, they revolve and because of their shape/postitioning, they gently express the milk in a similar way to baby's tongue. (egg: flat/standing/flat/standing = rolling motion). A flexible cord leads milk to pouch in flask on hip. The soft disk with the integrated eggs could be placed in a bra over night, maybe even with a timer, so night expressing could happen while you sleep. During the day at the office, one could wear a bra with a sturdier cover, so the rolling of the eggs would not be seen moving under blouse. The hip pouch/flask could also be hidden inside skirt/trousers.
If unclear I can make a sketch. Best regards, Annina Goetschi    annina1972@yahoo.com.
