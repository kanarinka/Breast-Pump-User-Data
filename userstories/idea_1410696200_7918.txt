This is the video my LC had me watch in preparation for hard-core pumping. A "hands-free" pump is not hands-free if one's hands have to be doing this the whole time. No idea how to automate the very important work of massage, which was crucial for my output, but oh man, if someone else can figure this out that'd be amazing. http://newborns.stanford.edu/Breastfeeding/MaxProduction.html
