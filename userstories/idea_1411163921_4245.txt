I have 4 kids.  As a working mom, I pumped after returning to work for all 4 of them up until they turned 1 yr.  (I also continued to nurse when I was at home...right up until each kid turned about 2.)

My youngest is only 18 mo, so my latest pumping escapade is fresh in my mind.  Here are a few things that made pumping suck:

- I had to pump at home (before work) as well as at work to get enough milk.  This meant lugging the stupid thing around.

- While lugging it around, I sometimes forgot to put my milk in the fridge during transition (i.e. when I just got home or whatever).  This reduced the life of the milk.  (Occasionally I ruined some...)

- Carrying a huge bag, although discrete, through a male-dominated company was sometimes embarrassing.  (Huge black bag...)

- Getting comfortable while pumping...well it never happened.

- The pump is simply not efficient.  It is a huge time commitment.  I know many women who ended up "failing" here because they couldn't pump enough with the time they had.  (By fail - I mean simply they weren't able to pump enough milk to sustain their baby.)

- Pumps are noisy.  You could hear mine outside the pump room.

- I always wished I could figure out a way to pump at my desk (discretely of course) so that I wouldn't have to hide in a room with no WiFi available.  If I could have done this, it wouldn't really matter how long it took me.  I could be working at my desk.  (This would also mean that while discrete, it would have to be hands free.)


I think that is all I can think of for now.  I'm sure none of this is new info though.  I'm glad to see folks giving thought to making things a little easier for women.

Thanks,
