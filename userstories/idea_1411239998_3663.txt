I am trying to pump enough for my daughter and to donate to a milk bank to help save the lives of premature babies.  It is getting hard for me to pump enough because my "economy prized pump" is starting to wear out. I priced new hospital grade pumps are 500-600 dollars.

I would love for MIT students to hack a pump to make it as resilient as a hospital grade pump for an enconomic pump price.  This would help future mothers pump for their babies and for the most fragile members of our population. 

Thanks, MIT students!
