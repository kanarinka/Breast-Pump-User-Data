The hard plastic is too uncomfortable.  It would be better out of a softer silicon substance.  Try a soft plastic similar to that used in the nose piece for a sleep apnea mask.  Also, similar to the apnea mask nose pieces, the pump cups should come in different sizes.  Finally, it would be great if it could be worn, hooked on like a bra, so you could have hands free during some of the time while pumping.

Looking forward to success!
