while nursing my sweet baby to bed I thought...how about a pump that has a bottle, your baby sucks on it and the machine can take your baby's personalized sucking pattern (the stimulation, the long sucks etc...) and mimic it when you then pump later on, then the flanges instead of being a weird cone shape...it would be a silicon motorized contraption that is much more like a mouth around your nipples so no weird pulling just on the nipple and skin around, but rather, its much more like the baby's suck, and maybe a warming sensation to make it more realistic and comfortable. can't wait to see what you all come up with!
