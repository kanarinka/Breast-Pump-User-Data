Mimic a baby's suckle more accurately... pumps just have suction, but if you hand-express milk you have no suction. Baby's mouths (who are the experts at extracting milk) must use a combination of the two actions.

Data tracking - length of sessions, which breast, measure amount pumped - not all moms require this, but it could be useful to many.

Better pumping bra for hands-free support.

Able to lay down to pump? Might be ambitious.

Best of luck! Thank you for doing this :D
