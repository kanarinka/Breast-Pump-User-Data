5 oz capacity, cup shaped bag inserts for a bra attachment, where the flange gets inserted into the bra cup, the pumping mechanism rests above the breast, and the collection bags are outside of the bra. The jam sheets (cool stuff) could mold to create suction around the nipple, and coating it in the gel that they make Soothies from could lend the ability to create a moisture barrier for women wanting to nurse while laying down. The most awkward part of the pump is the bottle because it's so bulky. Even the pump diaphragm and valve are not very bulky, and perhaps there's even a way to make them compact. Good luck!!!!!!! :)
