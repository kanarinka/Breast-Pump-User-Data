Hi,

I think your project is fantastic.  I have asked myself so many times why no one has done this yet.  

After the recent birth of my second child I pumped almost exclusively for 2 months while he was in the NICU.  I used the NICU pumps (Ameda) and am now using Medela pumps in a lactation room provided at work.  One big complaint that I have is that the pumps are not all that durable, despite being hospital grade.  These things are used by a lot of women over a long period of time and they show a lot of wear and tear.  This affects things like suction and noise level.  Could you please keep durability in mind as you think about design?  

Also, I have a cubicle at work with high walls and a door, so I have some privacy but there is absolutely no sound barrier.  If there was a pump that was quiet enough that I could use it at my desk it would be life changing.  

Third suggestion: Cleanliness is a huge issue.  Sinks are not readily available at my office, other than dirty bathroom sinks that are far away.  If there were less parts to clean, or if they could be quickly wiped clean with a sanitizing cloth, it would make a big difference.

Thank you,
