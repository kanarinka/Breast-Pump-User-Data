Hi!

I was really intrigued to learn about your hack-a-thon. Way to go!

I was one of those moms who could never really multi-task while pumping because my hands had to be on the flanges, moving them around, massaging them, encouraging those boobs to relinquish every last millilitre of milk they possibly could. Wouldn’t it be amazing if the flanges could do the massaging for you? So, like I’m picturing flanges that aren’t hard and stiff, but are kind of rubbery and had sensors that put pressure on your breasts in a massaging fashion — or better still, that could be “smart” and learn where your most active ducts were so that it could concentrate on those ones? I came to resent the amount of time I had to take away from my work when I was pumping after returning to work. It was damned hard to making up that hour I missed from work everyday (I needed 20 mins each time, plus 10 mins for set up, redressing x 2).

Not sad to be done with pumping, or BF in general (almost there…), but I am glad I persevered through it. 

I’ll be keen to see what emerges from this. Thanks for doing it.
