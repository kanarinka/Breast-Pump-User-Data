Hi Fabulous MIT Team (kudos to the men involved in this project too)!
I am so sorry to have missed this and to have just found out about this project! 
I am a full time working mother that has an 17 1/2 month old.  I still breast feed and STILL pump at work. I travel all over the world and have been to Italy, Paris, Belgium, Japan, Korean and Vietnam and have pumped all along the way. I work in product development and have a TON of ideas for improving the breast pump experience. I am actually looking to partner with someone to create my idea. I currently work in beauty in San Francisco but have experience in fashion, beauty, consumer electronics and soft goods. I would love two things: helping in any way possible; testing product, product ideation (I already see flaws in the approved designs) and also maybe being put in touch with a manufacturer and mechanical engineer to work out my ideas into a project; however, I don't want to give my ideas away. I have worked and pump too hard to give them up- from pumping in front of the Arch de Triomphe in Paris, which sounds WAY more glorious than it is and is more relatable to peeing in public to pumping in many disgusting bathrooms throughout the continents. I truly believe in the power of breast milk and helping women be empowered to keep that bond with their children longer.  I want to start a company that revolutionizes the breast pumping experience. Any help would be appreciated and LOVE what you are doing. My email is: tiilaabbitt@gmail.com
I hope to hear from you soon.
Thank you so much!!!
