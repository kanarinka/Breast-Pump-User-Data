Thank you for creating this hackathon to make the world a better place for all of us breastfeeding parents!! After countless hours pumping and thinking each time about how pumping can be made better, I've realized that massage (push pressure applied throughout the breast mimicking hand expression) instead of suction (pull pressure) applied to the nipples and area surrounding areolas are much more effective and gentle at getting the milk out. I'm really wondering if a wearable, molded silicon pump (like a bra) is the way to go as a breast pump. Would love some kind of expansion technology (like balloons in bra applied rhythmic push pressure) to get the milk out instead of the pull/draw suction of current breast pumps.

I would love to get involved in this more if that's possible!
