Thanks for the clarifying question- I mean that women use breast pumps differently depending on their milk production and collection needs. For women using pumps to increase or stimulate milk production they pump even when milk is not being expressed because they are using the pump to tell the breasts to produce more milk. Conversely other women who have adequate milk supply the pump to collect their milk. Women with low supply need to know how long to leave the pump on for optimal breast stimulation so a timer could help in this regard. Women with adequate supply turn off the pump when milk stops being expressed so they wouldn't need a timer to tell them to turn off the pump, but a timer could be helpful to them for other reasons. In general I wonder how designing a breast pump with these different uses (I.e. increasing production vs. collecting adequate supply) might be useful to functionality planning.
