Hello,

I just heard about this incredible event via Facebook/Huffpost.  I'm a Materials Engineer in CA with a 17-month old son; we have a family wedding next weekend or I would be buying a plane ticket now.  I'm actually tempted to skip the wedding and join you.

I had to exclusively pump after a traumatic birth and delayed lactation onset. I pumped everywhere for hours: home, work, Disneyland, even while I was driving!  I have obsessed over obvious design improvements needed in this critical experience.  You guys are SO awesome for doing this and I am dying to participate. Let's talk about sharing the outcome with the Society of Women Engineers:  our national conference is October 23-37 in Los Angeles.

I challenge the idea of the required displacement of breast tissue: we can have low-profile flanges that collect milk and channel it into slimline "hip flask" like containers that fit into a light weight vest or belt that can be worn hands free under clothing.  I dream of flanges that can be inserted into a regular bra in which the tubes have a rigid stiffener for a segment that runs under the bra's band or wire.  As you've noted, designs and check valves are possible to enable laying down:  imagine a timer that let's me pump while I take a nap or hold my baby!

How about special receivers for colostrum, ie vials?? Take a mom like me out of the the OR, baby has gone off to NICU and I can just "suit up" during recovery and capture that golden hour???!!

I wish you guys infinite success with this.  I hope Medela listens, their flanges are the worst!
