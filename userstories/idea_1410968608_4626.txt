I'm short and it always bothered me how far down the bottles stuck out. I could barely move without bumping them. The collection device should be relocated or the shape redesigned so they are more ergonomic while pumping. It would also be great if you didn't have to be so exposed while pumping. Maybe a shorter nozzle so that the vacuum portion could fit under a shirt.
