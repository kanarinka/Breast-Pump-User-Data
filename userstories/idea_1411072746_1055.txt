The hard plastic parts that cover the breast to pump dont fit every body and they are so hard they hurt!  And breast pumping is a seriously time consuming process... Think about it... You have a new baby you need to pump so you have to put the baby down or wait for someone to take the baby then you have to clean all the parts and pray that water doesnt get into the tubes or you will need to buy new tubes then you have to purchase a bra in order to pump both boobs at the same time so finally you are strapped into this contraption... You are committed... Then you pump and if you are lucky 10 minutes you fill each bag, then you turn it off  and you slowly have to remove each bag but have to be hyper aware of each bag because they can spill and it happened to me everytime i would spill my liquid gold everywhere!  Then finally i take the bra off clean the parts if i have time or remember... Then race downstairs, label the bag put it in the freezer, try to feed my baby with my swollen pained boobs...  Breast pumping does suck!  Please make it better before my next child who i plan to conceieve this time next year...
