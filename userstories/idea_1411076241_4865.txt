Are you planning on hacking the entire thing? (pump alone or including the parts that go from the pump to mom?)
- They're usually quite loud so if they could be silenced in some way or reduce the sound that would be great.
- I like the idea of the Freestyle by Medela but that pump is awful. The portability, easy part assembly, rechargeable battery - those are great, everything else...not so much.
- Have the ability to adjust both vacuum and speed. Ameda pumps have that but Medela pumps don't. Fine tuning is important to a mom for both comfort and volume.
- Could there be a smaller design? They're quite bulky in size. 
- If you're hacking the pumping kit too, the breast flanges are lame. Hard plastic or one choice of softer flexible plastic but it's still not awesome. Something that can really be comfortable and for moms with different sized nipples
- make it a closed system
- make it FDA approved
- make it WHO compliant
