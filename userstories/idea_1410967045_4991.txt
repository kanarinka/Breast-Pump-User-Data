Noise - so my work colleagues don't hear what I'm doing!
Make it more discreet to cover me up while I am pumping while having option to peek in and see what is happening.
Is there a way to show me visually that the pump parts have reached the right temp to be sterile? Eg in dishwasher.
Make it ergonomically easier to hold pump in place on one side while feeding baby on other.

Thanks for doing this project!!
