I saw this hackathon and think it is amazing! What a great topic and millions of moms would love you if you found a better solution!

My son was born April very unexpected and suddenly at 30 weeks old. He spent 2.5 months in the NICU and fought each day to get stronger. From the first day he was born I began pumping. At the beginning they were feeding him my milk on a q-tip. I was pumping 8-10 times a day to ensure he was getting only breast milk. I would pump at home, at the hospital, even in the car with a manual pump sometime (ouch!). My son is now home (and thank god healthy) but I have returned to work so the pumping continues. I hate it but it is just something you do for your children. Here are some of my biggest complaints/areas of improvements:

- it hurts
- it is noisy
- there are too many damn parts and I feel like I am constantly washing them
- you should be able to charge or run on battery. Finding an outlet is not always easy
- it could be smaller and more portable the engine.
- it needs a slicker chic carrying case
- it's ugly, not personal and you feel like it's you and the machine. Imagine instead you load a picture of your baby or could play soothing music instead of hearing the suction of the machine
- could it be tubeless? Just the shield and bottle in a hands free way?

Anyway I love this idea and am excited to see the results

Good luck!
