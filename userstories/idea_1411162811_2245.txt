Thank you for taking this important matter seriously.

Problem: Having to Get Naked In Your Office to Pump
Solution: Devices That Do Not Stick Out Five Inches From Your Chest, and Can Slip Easily Beneath Clothes
Description: Banish the cone-bra effect! What I am envisioning is something as unobtrusive and well-designed as an iPhone earbud - I leave it to the experts to figure out how that would work with the suction, however.

Problem: Cleaning Parts at Work Using a Communal Restroom Sink/Communal Microwave
Solution: Cheap, Recyclable, Disposable Parts for Each Pumping Session.
Description: If that's not possible, then please figure out a way to reduce the price of pump wipes -- they only come 24 to a pack, are $8-10, and are only available in specialty stores or online, not your local pharmacy or grocery stores. 

Problem: Too Many Parts!
Solution: Less Parts!
Description: I counted 18 distinct parts in my pumping set. Twice thus far, I have accidentally left one or two pieces in the dish drying rack at home, forcing me to leave work in the middle of the day to pump because the entire mechanism will not work without every single part.

Please let me know if I can help in anyway with this effort.
