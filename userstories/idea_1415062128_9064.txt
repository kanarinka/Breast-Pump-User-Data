I have no ideas. I just wanted to say that as someone whose baby was exclusively fed on expressed milk for the first 8 months of his life (he refused solids until then - I was just so thrilled, I can't tell you. Oh, wait...) I love you. It's one of those quietly hellish experiences so many women have, and so few ever mention. This could prevent so much post-partum depression. Thank you, truly.
