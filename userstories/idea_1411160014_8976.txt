I am so excited just having read about this project. I used a pump for 8 months after I went back to work and expect I'll need to pump again when we have more children. A couple of things that I thought about while pumping:
- It would be nice to have a mobile pump unit that I could wear on a belt or something like that and be able to walk around the house and do things. I didn't always make enough milk during the work day (if I was too stressed) so I would pump in the middle of the night or before work. It drove me nuts to be confined to the chair or bed when I could be using that time to empty the dishwasher or put laundry in or sweep. All glamorous tasks, I know, but when you're working, pumping, and taking care of an infant, every second you have to spend awake counts. or if there was a breast pump I could wear while sleeping, and not worry about my position, that would be great too. get all the good milk and catch up on rest. 
- Cleaning pump parts and bottles was the other big hassle. I'm really fortunate that my husband tried to help out with this as much as he could. I also had many spare sets of things so I didn't have to wash EVERY day. But if my toothbrush can have a UV sanitizer built into the device, why can't my breast pump have a similar feature? I don't know if that would clean it enough to make it healthy for a baby, but there's got to be something that makes cleaning easier.

Thanks so much for taking this on. I can't wait to see what comes out of it!
