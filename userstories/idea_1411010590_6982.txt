Moms with babies in the NICU have to pump around the clock to build supply. It wears you down and you are as exhausted as if your baby was home, except you have the added crap of spending all day at the hospital with your preemie or sick baby.

I dreamt of an in-your-sleep pump. You put it on before bed (I don't even care how many tubes) and it just turns on and does its thing every two hours overnight, and you wake up refreshed to a gallon of milk. Every NICU mom would about die for this.
