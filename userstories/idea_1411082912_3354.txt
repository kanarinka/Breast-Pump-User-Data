IMO the ameda pump is pretty good, easy to clean, relatively easy to operate one handed, battery operated if need be, not too heavy, not too noisy, etc, but its big weakness is the very poor quality of the valves, which wear out very quickly. They are such a weak point that I will be trying another brand with my next child.
