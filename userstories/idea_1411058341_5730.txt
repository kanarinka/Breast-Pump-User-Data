I previously submitted an idea for an untethered breast pump that could be worn discreetly under clothing while being able to hold several ounces of milk.  The more I pondered a design concept, I thought about a bra that could contain the pump components, while the outer "shell" of the bra could store the milk. It would be much like a "water" or gel bra. It wouldn't make for any awkward storage, rather, the bust would just look fuller.
