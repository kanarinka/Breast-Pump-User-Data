 I have had this idea for a while, so I'm very happy to get to share it with someone who might be able to do something with it. When I used a manual pump, I always found that I could control the speed and force of the pump much better than with an electric pump, meaning pumping was more effective, but my hands got tired very quickly. You should design a non-electric pump that operates with a foot pedal similar to what you use for a sewing machine. It would be silent, easier to vary the speed, more affordable than electric and I don't think it would fatigue the leg/foot in nearly the same way as other manual pumps do to the hands.
