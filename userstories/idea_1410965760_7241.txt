* keep the pump & all it's parts small enough to carry in a bag that is commuter friendly. 
* battery options - would be nice to have a rechargeable pump - continuing to buy batteries is not environmentally friendly.  
* they say pumps are no good after 1 year. and you cannot reuse the pump for baby #2. but may moms pump longer than a year and many moms have more than 1 baby. this need help. 
* I've had to purchase replacement parts a few times in the last 11 months. more sturdy, long lasting parts would be helpful. 
* pump manufacturers send you a one-size-fits-most flange, but every mom I know has purchased bigger flanges…or they have different sizes for each breast. maybe something that is modular? 
* the pump is loud…you cannot pump in public places ( even if you find a private area) because the pump sound is loud.  Any way to minimize that would be nice! 
* BEST OF LUCK! this is so very exciting to have MIT part of the answer to our problem.  I worked at MIT Media Lab a few years ago with Tod Machover, and I know y'all are awesome. Keep up the good work!
