I would love: 

Timed interval pumping while I sleep
Better suction
An attachment with the ability to compress of massage from the outer limits of the breast towards the nipple to ensure that all milk is being emptied. Its very hard to do self compression while holding the bottles. I only have two hands. 
Quieter
Easy to clean
No bottles. I want to pump straight into the storage bags.
Improve suction and output volume. My kid can empty a breast 4X faster than a pump. I don't think a pump can ever beat a hungry kid in a timed trial, but there has to be a way to get more, without having my nipple stretched an inch long with the suction. 
Smaller and less cumbersome. Testing should occur in tiny spaces, like airplane bathrooms, small closets, back passenger seats (next to a monstrous car seats).

Canâ€™t wait to hear what you come up with!
