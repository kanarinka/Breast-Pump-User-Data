Loved the article. So I am actually a military mom and I'm always on the go. And I'm only allowed to pump for the first year of my sons life because at that year mark I will get sent back to my shop where I will end up dealing with allot if chemical hazards that could potentially be passed through my breast milk, their not sure but it could happen. If your serious about a pump that analyzes milk as it's being expressed I would gladly volunteer to be a Guinea pig. I could keep a log of what I had been exposed to and what times as well as the times that I pumped.

Also for your designs, I use the Medela, it's honestly the favorite of the 50+ girls I work with that have pumped recently or are currently pumping. The noise the pump makes is really our least concern. We have a limited time to pump and cleaning the parts takes a bit of time so most of the time it's either a quick rinse or some girls just carry enough parts for 3 separate sessions. There are times where we have appointments or were just on the go that we can't pump. I would like to see more discreet parts that my shirt would more easily cover. I tend to have to drive allot and I pump while I'm headed to my destination. Playtex had a good idea with the silicone inserts, but I hated that pump. No different sizes for the flanges, and no replacement parts. Biggest thing right there, replacement parts. I cannot stress that enough, my dog has literally destroyed the accessories to my pump, that's part of why my playtex pump broke, the other was it was not dish washer safe. It wasn't even sterilizer safe. Right after I bought my Medela he chewed up the elbow and flange off one side. It was clean, went through the dishwasher and had been hand washed, so unless there's a chance that some residual milk was there. And a more mobile pump, better to multitask with, and the cute little hands free straps, better sizing options, not all of us are 5'4" 120 lbs. some I us are built for harder work.
