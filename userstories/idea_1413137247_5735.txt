I've tried a few retail pumps since had my two kids. I called up one pump maker and asked if they had breast flange sizes other than the standard 25mm and 30mm. They did not and referred me to a third party website selling breast flanges compatible with their pump. I'm wondering if there could be more breast flange sizes, for moms whose in between what is considered standard for a breast flange. One of my pumps come with a 25mm as their standard, and another I own has 26mm standard. Both for me is far too small. I use a 27.5mm flange with my Ameda and that is the most comfortable flange size I've tried thus far. Some moms need a size other than what is considered standard to get the most milk expressed in a short amount of time. I'd also suggest a breast flange that isn't a hard plastic material and that more companies include all their breast flanges offered with their pump. I didn't know I needed a bigger breast flange until I came across the information on them on Medela's website. Even lactation consultants, don't give out the proper information on breast flange sizing!
