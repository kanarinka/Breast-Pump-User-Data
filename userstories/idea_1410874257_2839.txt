Have a better system to pump right into the storage bags rather than the bulky bottles.  ... And have when double pumping have both sides fill up a single bag.  After pumping you always have to combine the 2 sides and that's where you can spill.  (Whoever said "Don't cry over spilled milk" was not a nursing mom!)
