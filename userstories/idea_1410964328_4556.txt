Babies are cute with big loving eyes that stare up at mommy while nursing. The plastic cups of a pump more closely resemble the contraption farmers use to milk a cow. I don't like feeling like a cow. Also, my baby is warm and cuddly on my tummy when I pull my shirt up to feed him. A pump leaves my tummy exposed to the chilly air. Also, if my baby made the sucking sound that electric pumps make, he would have a terrible latch. I hate that sound. It just makes me miss my quiet baby.
