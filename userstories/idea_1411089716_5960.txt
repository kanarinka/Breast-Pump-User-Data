Make it quiet, make it easy to clean, make a very inconspicuous case to carry it in. As the only woman engineer with a group of guys it was very embarassing to pump with a very loud pump and to have to carry an obvious pump pack and igloo cooler with bottles to and from the bathroom to keep breastfeeding beyond the first 6 weeks. I made it through two baby boys who are now in college, but remember those days well. One young father knew what was up and actually helped me put the cooler out of harms way during the day, though we never really talked about it.
