What a great concept!!   I hope you come up with some innovative ideas.  Working moms around the world will rejoice!  

I will say that as a lactation consultant (IBCLC) and supporter of the World Health Organization's International Code on the Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes, I am disappointed to see Medela sponsoring this project.  They are a Code violator and should be encouraged to revamp their branding and marketing to meet these international standards.  Thanks for your consideration of this issue!
