So exciting, what you're doing! Here were a few things that jumped into my head as I read through the article.

Maybe voice activated on and off feature (since my hands are usually holding the flanges, on and off is always tricky, painful cuz I have to crank it to the level I need and rather than gradually increase suction, I start at the max and latch them on, and messy) a timer that can be set to automatically stop after a set number of minutes (maybe voice activated option. "Timer. 7 minutes. Start."), also voice activated option to increase pumping intensity, an alert to your phone to remind you to pump, and the ability to customize the housing maybe (I have the medela pump in style that has a bag housing for the pump) to put pics of your baby in clear pockets so when you pump you can look at your baby to help w letdown. Hah, and a crying baby sound effect feature! (Just kidding kind of, but when I hear a baby crying anywhere, it always triggers a let down.) Actually, if there was ear buds and you could listen to baby sounds of eating and/or crying or cooing, that could actually be kind of cool. And maybe an option for some relaxing music to counter the stresses of closet pumping and create more relaxation to help w let down. Since nursing is a full sensory experience an audio feature could be interesting. I guess ultimately if there's an associated app it could offer those features via the smart phone. A record your baby sounds option through that and some different music options, maybe partnered w "8-track" or "songza"  

I'll send in more as they come to me. :) Thanks for doing this and even just exploring what can be done.
