What a wonderful idea! I'm at the tail end of breast feeding 3 children now, but I wish I had had a better pump when I was more active.

If the interface could be more interactive, that would be great.  Heck, if you could just plug your smartphone into it and run it via your favourite app would be great!

For the most part, I just wanted to say Well Done! And thank you for considering this project.  While my personal breast feeding experience was "successful", I know that an easier and more encouraging pumping experience would help millions of Mom's make it work.
