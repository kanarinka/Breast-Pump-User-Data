Transportable! For those of us pumping exclusively, it would be nice to have a powerful pump that we can carry with us. I have visions of a pump that you can clip to your belt and, in conjunction with a hands free bra, walk around the house. In other words, it would be nice to not be confined to a chair when pumping.
