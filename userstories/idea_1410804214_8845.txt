I would like a pump-friendly accessory that will apply pressure to the breast while massaging - all while being hands free.  I need to abuse the heck out of my breasts - I mean, massage and apply pressure - while pumping to get any decent output.  Some sort of pumping bra that had moving, massaging beads and perhaps a cycling pressure cuff, sort of like using a blood pressure cuff, would be awesome.
