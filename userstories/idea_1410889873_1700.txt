Also it annoys me that there isn't really a clear instructional guide for moms that pump exclusively.. I feel like most lactation consultants and pediatricians say either breast or bottle and pumping is frowned upon unless you have a nicu baby. Why is there such a negative stigma on pumping? I also think there needs to be more clear cut instructions for pumping for new moms such as amounts that are typical to be expressed at each age milestones. Not like oh.. Pump every few hours for as long as you feel like it and pray it's enough to keep your baby from starving. Haha
