A pump that wasn't so loud would be nice. Also, of the pump could be at an angle so I don't have to lean forward making sure that the milk doesn't pool up. And finally a way to start the pump slow until you get it to your desired velocity and then when you're down, a way to slow down the suction even your done so you don't just turn it off
