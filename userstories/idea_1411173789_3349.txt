I served in the Virginia National Guard while my daughter was breastfeeding. Being away from her for a weekend I would use a hand pump over an automatic for several reasons. It was quiet, extremely small and convenient to use in a side office or restroom where electrical outlets weren't in easy to use locations. 

I know there is at least one cordless on the market for several hundred dollars. If there was a way to make this more affordable I know it would help a lot of mommies out there!
