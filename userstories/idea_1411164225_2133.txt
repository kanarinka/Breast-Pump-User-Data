Hospital grade pumps are made with sealed motors so that they can be shared by multiple people.  Commercial pumps are frequently shared, but their motors are not sealed so germs can get from one mother to another mother's baby.  People get their friend's old pump, and she may even pass it on to a third woman (and baby) if she doesn't use it much.  It would be better if all pumps were safe to share (after normal cleaning).  

Also, I've used the Medela Symphony, and I know that some people need the lowest suction setting, but I thought that even the highest setting didn't have enough suction.  So, more suction range, perhaps.  

Flange comfort and fit are often a problem.  And how many damn parts there are!  I, personally, would avoid iPhone interfaces with the pumps because it would add yet another layer of complexity.  Some pumps are more complicated than others.  The Bailey pump is complicated to assemble, but many mothers like that you are in total control over how much suction you have and how long the suction lasts.  Take a look at the Bailey; it's very different than the Amedas and Medelas.  

What if all pumps were hands free?  What about voice control?  That would be awesome!!!
