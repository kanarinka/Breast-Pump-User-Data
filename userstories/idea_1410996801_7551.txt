As a working mom/teacher I had to pump on my 15 minute break and 30 minute lunch and did not have time to spare as students were waiting.  Putting my pump together took up half of the time! I had to pull everything out of the bag plug in 2 separate cords put all the pieces together and then go. Having a small pump that has all tge parts already attached would be 
amazing!
