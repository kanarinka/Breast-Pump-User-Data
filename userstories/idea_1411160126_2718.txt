No idea how to accomplish it, but women would be more relaxed, and thus likely pump better/more, if they could lean back while pumping.

At present, a woman has to sit completely upright or even lean forward in order for milk to flow into the collection bottle (e.g., the Medela pump in style). If she leans back, pumping still happens but milk collects in the flange around the nipple and she needs to tilt forward for it to drain into the bottle every ~30 seconds. If suction is accidentally broken, a considerable amount of milk goes down her front.

Good luck this fall!
