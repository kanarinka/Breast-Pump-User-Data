The biggest nightmare is having to clean all the equipment between pumping sessions.  I had my first daughter during residency and while on a 30 hour shift, often had to clean the equiptment 10 times.  It was brutal.  Microwaving plastic parts felt so gross and unhealthy to me so instead, I used a hospital wash-basin and hand washed them and laid them out to dry between each session.  I fantasized about disposable parts every time. 

Also those medela and lasinoh bags... They are great because they store large amounts but they always seem to spill and seem to waste a lot of milk.
