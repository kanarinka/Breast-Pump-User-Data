
I use a Medela pump. The air intake hole is on the front of the elbow piece, and this is a problem because when I'm trying to multitask (pumping while watching my twin infants), and I need to pick up one of my infants, I lean over and the milk pours out of this hole from the collection bottle. A simple fix would be to put the air intake hole closest to the mother's body so leaning forward doesn't cause spillage. It's really hard to keep squatting down very carefully to keep the bottles level, as one or both of my infants is fussy and needing attention.
