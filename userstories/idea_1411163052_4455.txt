-It would be amazing if the breast pump could be adjusted in terms of the pressure it put against the breasts. Even with a hands free pumping bra, I always had to use my hands to put pressure against my breasts in order to get any decent output (and I know other women with similar issues). I would have loved if the bra could have done that for me.

-Obviously, the pump should be silent to avoid embarrassing situations, like pumping in a restroom and hearing a group of people saying "OMG what is that weird noise??"

-It should be flat somehow, so that it fits under clothes without making huge gigantic bulges under the shirt. That way a woman who is walked in on won't feel embarrassed or have to be half naked in a supply closet/"pumping room."

-The tubes should be longer and much harder to take off so that if you stretch a little too far, it doesn't come unplugged.

-Fewer parts, easier to clean, closed system

-An easy way to see exactly how much milk you have pumped and a hard to spill collection system.
