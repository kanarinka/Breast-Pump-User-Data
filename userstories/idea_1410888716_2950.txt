All of the parts are a pain in the butt...especially if you lose, say a flap, while you're washing the parts out at work. Or, the tube gets a kink in it. You have to special order the majority of these parts because stores don't always carry them, so it's a HUGE pain in the butt...I mean, how are you going to pump if you're missing a part? The solution: a manual pump...the worst punishment known to moms. 20 minutes to MAYBE get an ounce of milk and you can no longer feel your arms afterwards!
