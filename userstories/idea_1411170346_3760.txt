I had to exclusively pump for the first three months of my daughter's life due to severe latch issues and because the breast pump is never as effective as the mouth of a baby, my supply was never established (in breastfeeding terms my milk never came in.) we always had to supplement with formula. 

Therefore my idea is simple: make the pump as effective as a baby! Accomplish this by making it simulate a warm, moist environment and replicate the tongue movement of a baby on the entire areola instead of air sucking at your nipple! 

Also, i had to use a hospital grade pump that was insanely bulky, cumbersome, and always had to be neR an outlet. Make it light and able to keep a charge for multiple sessions. 

Thanks!
