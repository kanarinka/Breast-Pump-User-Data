I a exclusively pump for my 2 month old. Here are some ideas I have that would be nice on a breast pump:

Quiet motor
Timer with auto shut off
Able to lay down while pumping
The more compact the better-have to carry with me anytime I go somewhere more than 2-3 hours
Hands free without using a special bra
Easier to clean parts

I appreciate what you're doing. Thanks!
