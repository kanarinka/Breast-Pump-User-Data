Hi all,

I read about the breast pump hackathon with great interest—partly because my husband is a Media Lab alumnus, but mostly because our daughter Augusta was born six weeks early last fall and spent sixteen days in the NICU. My breast pump was a constant (and unwelcome) companion; I always joked that I felt like it was sucking out my soul! It looks like a lot of great ideas are being explored already—I remember wishing for soft, heated flanges; a more convenient hands-free option; and fewer parts to wash. Even now I use an app to keep track of Augusta's nursing time and meals; a pump that could communicate directly with a smartphone or computer would be great for exhausted parents! I wanted to add that a pump that enabled the printing of timestamped labels, maybe even the amount of milk pumped, would be so helpful, especially for NICU moms pumping 8-10 times a day.

Thanks, and keep up the good work!
