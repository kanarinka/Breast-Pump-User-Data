Very interesting article that you wrote. Have been in design, sales and marketing of breastpumps for many years this is a difficult area. This is not an area that conforms easily to using new technologies as there is inherent complexities among them

1. Breast size and shape
2. Nipple size shape and aerola shape
3. Placement of ducs
4. Diameter of Ducts
5. Milk Production capabilites
6. Let Down facilitation
7. Pump Shield design (soft hard)
8. Pump durability
9. Pump Vacuum Type (piston, diaphragm, venturi,)
10. Suction Curve vs Yield Curve
11. Changes in Shield size reduce or increase extraction Pressures

You should also be aware that recent information has shown that breastpumps are not very effective in emptying the breast (Stanford). Massage while pumping using is far superior and   yields:

1. More Milk
2. Higher Quality Milk3. Potential Faster extraction speeds

attached is a couple of studies. Low tech is sometimes better that high tech.

Best of luck let us know if we can assist. Very complex area.
