I'm a mom to a 6 month old and I have been nursing and pumping while at work. I returned to work after 12 weeks and my supply immediately decreased. It has been a struggle since them to pump enough and pump efficiently. I would love a breast pump that better mimics the sucking pattern of a nursing baby. I can nurse my baby in 10 minutes but it takes upwards of 30 minutes to pump and even then I don't pump enough.
