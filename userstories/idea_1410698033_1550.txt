This rules so much. Thanks MIT! I'd love a pump with a rechargeable battery, that I could sling over my shoulder and walk around with. In the house, of course!!
Also.. I wish we could also better educate companies on the do's and dont's of what a pump room should be. Like, maybe make it semi comfortable? Y'know, remove the half dozens VCRs, old deodorants, talking Bass fish wall mount thing, and make sure all the windows have a damn curtain. Not that I speak from experience or anything....
