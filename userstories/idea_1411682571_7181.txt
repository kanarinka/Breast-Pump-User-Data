Combine the breast pump that can be worn under clothing with a voice command function.  I'm a surgeon returning to work next week and will be pumping for my now 8-week-old son for hopefully the next year.  Sometimes when we operate we don't "scrub out," i.e. remove our hands from the sterile field, for 8 hours or more.  If the breast pump could be operated without a need to scrub out it could empower female surgeons to provide breast milk after a return to work.  If anyone ever comes up with a prototype of a pump to be worn under clothing, with or without a voice command function, I'd love to try it...allison_jean_porter@hotmail.com.
