Least amount of parts possible. Medela is pretty close but then it is an open system so there is potential for contamination. Aveda has a nice idea with the closed system but so many parts and their valves were very finicky.  A pump should be able to withstand exclusive pumping.  This means a 20 to 30 minute session every 3 to 4 hours for 1 year. I have had 2 Medela and 1 ameda and the motors all developed reduced suction or completely burned out after 6 months.  Efficiency and durability are important. It should pump the most amount possible in the least amount of time which will help working mom's stuck to it longer.
