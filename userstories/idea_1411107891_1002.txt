Well when I pump my actual breast becomes sore. I would love to see a breast pump that massages with heat the actual breast because sometimes I don't even need the sucking action to express milk. It should have the concept of a heat pad and the suction cups need to have a gel pad instead of that plas tic. That crap hurts. It almost feel like I need lubrication for my pump. Which now that doesn't seem like a bad idea either.
