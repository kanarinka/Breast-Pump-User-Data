Thanks so much for caring about breast pumps and how much they suck! My son was born with a cleft palate and I pumped exclusively for 15 months (he never breastfed).

One thing that made my life about a million times easier was when we figured out I could pump while driving/riding in a car. It sounds crazy but was awesome, since one of the worst things about pumping is that it takes so much precious time.  Just wanted to put it out there that if you could make this a regular feature of pumps it might help some other moms.

Thanks again!
