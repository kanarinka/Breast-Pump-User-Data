It's not just that there are many parts that need cleaning - it's that the parts are hard to clean! I have two pumps, and they both have parts full of little tiny crevices. For the first several washes it all seems fine, but you inevitably start to see this gross gunky build-up in these little tiny places no brush or finger can reach. At one point I tried to clean it out with a toothpick!
