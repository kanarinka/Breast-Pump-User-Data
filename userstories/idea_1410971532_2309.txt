here is how many steps it take me from start to finish to pump at work:
1. find an empty room with a plug
2. bring in my pump and computer for something to do
3. plug in the pun
4 put together all the parts- screw in top to bottle, plug in tubes to the top
5. put on the weird bra thing
6.  put the tops over my breasts - 
7. pump 
8.  take out bottles post pumping
9. take off bra
10. put tops on bottles
11.  date and put name of child on bottle
12 put bottles in cool storage
13.  wash out bottles and top
14.  return to my desk

can we reduce these steps?
