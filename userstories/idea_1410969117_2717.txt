Maybe the flanges should be pliable (like rubber) so that they squeeze in on the nipples like a baby's mouth when sucking?
ALL pumps should automatically come with a highly-functioning, adjustable, comfortable hands-free nursing bra (like the Simple Wishes one), or a hands-free way to pump. The flanges should be angled like the Pumpin' Pals flanges so that you do not have to lean forward while pumping (which is especially difficult post-cesarean, when your abdominal muscles are shot and you are exhausted and probably need to pump to get your milk flowing). There should also be a better way to measure your breasts/nipples to find the correct flange size (I used the wrong size for months and had poor output and supply). All take home pumps should be as powerful as hospital-grade for quicker emptying. And the parts should be MUCH less cumbersome to put together, take apart, and clean. 

I am a women's health nurse practitioner and was STUNNED at how difficult I found pumping to be.
