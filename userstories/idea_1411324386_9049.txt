My issue is that I pump best when my son is feeding on the other side first thing in the morning. We love the lying down position for feeding.  After another night of not sleeping, it's hard to find a good angle for me, lying on my side, feeding my son, and pumping. A better pump would at least allow for more angles to help the flow of gravity and a longer, flexible piece from nipple to bottle to keep my son from kicking the bottle at the same time. It would be even better if I didn't need to hold the flange because to get the most milk I need to massage my breast,  too. Could the flange be extended into a massage for my boob?
