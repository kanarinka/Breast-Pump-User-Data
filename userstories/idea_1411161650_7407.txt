Hey everyone,
Being a veteran with experience in mechanical pumps of MANY designs, and the husband of a IBCLC and Postpardum DOULA, I have been going over the idea on how to make breast pumps better.
I am currently working on a design that YOUR wealth of knowledge would help shed some light on how to go about making an open-source breast pump.

Speaking of just the pump and the motor, I have found that manufacturing has gotten away from quality parts. And using cheaper pieces in both the pump and motor, they DO NOT last very long.
Sad, considering how much people pay for them!

My idea to to make a centrifugal/vane type of vacuum pump and have it simulate the action of a reciprocating vacuum pump. The centrifugal pump has less moving parts and will last longer on a small charge. Making it lighter to be carried around, and possibly with a battery pack, even portable to pump with.
The problem I am having is trying to figure out a programmable or micro-switch  operated relief valve that will give the stimulation required to enduce let-down and flow. 
This is one reason my all pumps have been using a reciprocating idea, because it is the closest mechanical interpretation of a baby nursing. 
Also I would still have manual adjustments for speed and strength. As I have seen on so many current pumps. So the mother could make manual changes to make it better for her.

I would love to hear from you. Either positive or negative comments are welcome. 
Since I am just trying to do what I can to help my wife and the MANY nursing Moms I know.
