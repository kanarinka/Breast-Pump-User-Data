Look at the mechanics of a baby's mouth when it breastfeeds... a baby coordinates both suction and compression to get milk out really efficiently. Breast pumps only use suction (sometimes to a painful degree) and are thus not nearly as efficient so it takes forever to pump enough milk and it can be really freaking uncomfortable.
