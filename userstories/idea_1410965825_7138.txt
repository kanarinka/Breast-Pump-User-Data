Start from scratch! Seriously, there is almost limitless room for improvement. The only thing I currently like: it expresses milk. That's it. My functionality wish list: something that doesn't require me to get half undressed several times a day - I want to strap it on in the am and then just connect it to some collection device that easily connects, seals, and disconnects. (I'm thinking almost like blood bank bags, then its ready to store too. I want to double pump into one collection bag or bottle. Silent. Portable. Efficient. 
Nice to have: massaging feature on the bra or cups, as massage is known to increase amount expressed. (The freemies are a good start as far as keeping your normal clothes on, but you still have to remove cups after pump to collect the milk. Ability to essentially wear the flanges all day without changing would make it far more discreet and sibstantially cut down on clean up/set up time. Milk is stable for many hours, so safety shouldn't be a problem if you are talking about 6hours of wear. 

Good luck! All of us who curse pumping very day are counting on you!
