Please find a hack to convert pumps that are considered open systems into closed systems, thereby allowing people to sell pumps or pass them on to other users once they are done with them. We're instructed by the FDA to throw out $200/$300 pumps after a single person uses them, because of the slight risk of infection that could be passed from one user to the next user's baby. I imagine that the addition of a sterile filter to the end of the tubing would prevent the transfer of bacteria/viruses from the breast to the pump, and from the pump to the baby's milk. I wasn't able to find out if filters exist that prevent the passage of HIV/Hepatitis/etc. This addition would result in three great improvements: it would eliminate all risk of contamination from bacteria transferring from the engine into the milk; it would cut down significantly on landfill waste as pumps could have multiple users; it would also make it possible for less-well-off people to have access to good pumps through the secondhand market. From my first child (single, battery-operated medela swing pump) to my second child (electric, double medela in style - about $200 more than the swing), I've learned firsthand how simply enormous a difference a good pump can make. This simple change would make a big difference to a significant number of mothers across the nation.
