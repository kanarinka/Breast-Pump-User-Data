Hi, 
Some ideas - the perfect pump would imitate an infant nursing - upper gums firmly, but gently on the aureola and the lower jaw doing all the work. 
A good idea would be to find a nursing mother who is good at expressing by hand as this, if done properly is more effective than a manual or electric pump. If a pum can replicate what the hand expressing mother is doing - you've got a winner. 

Also, on a different note - there needs to be more places in public, where you can express. Working mothers on the move who need to express are having to do it on loos - this is particularly disgusting when you end up in a toilet on the train. Eugh!

Hope this helps
