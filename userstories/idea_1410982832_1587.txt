Takes too long to get a second letdown!! I'm guessing this has a lot to do with the "anatomy" of the flanges and the rigid plastic. It hurts and makes nips really swollen! How can the flanges be structured to more closely mimic a suckling baby's mouth? Sounds strange but there is nothing on the market that has been able to come close.
