My biggest problem was strength of suction. Pumps need to suck the way that infants do. My pump was never strong enough (I have the Ameda Purely Yours, and have also tried the Medela Pump in Style and the Medela Freestyle). I was constantly replacing the small valve pieces on the Ameda to try to keep strong suction (it's the strongest of the 3 I've tried), but any small imperfection in those tiny valve parts and the suction drops dramatically. I would pump for 45 minutes and barely get what my baby could get in 5-10 minutes of nursing. Thank you for tackling this problem! It means a lot!
