How about a Breast Pump Station (like drive thru but a walk thru) where a mom can just drop in, connect her breast to the pump, pump for 10-15 minutes as needed, collect her milk and proceed with her work day. We need to figure out sanitation and contamination but worth a shot.   It's all about convenience!!!
