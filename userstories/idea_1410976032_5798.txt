The Medela Freestyle is "hands free" but the accessories that cone with it are a joke. I had to buy a special hands free pumping bra so I could pump as fast as possible with my 15 min work break. Also, if you lean forward slightly milk dumps out from the opening and spills everywhere! So it's only hands free as long as you remain still and don't lean forward! Thanks for doing thus foe all of us!!!!!!!!
