Hello. Thanks for taking this project on. My ideas:
1) change the material of the plastic horn to something softer like silicone. It may improve efficiency and it would be easier on the breast.

2 ) make the pump quieter. It is no fun pumping in a cubicle office when everyone within 10 meters can hear what you are doing.

3) eliminate the need to hook up tubing to the bottles. This causes spills. It would be great to find a way to snap in the bottles to the pumping mechanism.  The tubing could be inside and removed for cleaning. 

I can be reached at jennifer.m.free@gmail.com if there are questions. Also I just had my second child so if you would like someone to try a prototype pump please let me know. My husband and I are both engineers and live in Florida. 

Sincerely, 
Jennifer Free
