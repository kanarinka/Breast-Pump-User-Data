I have a medela pump in style. I want there to be less adhesion of milk to the plastic parts. I lose a lot of milk just from what's stuck on the sides of the flanges, connectors, and bottles. No matter how hard I try to tap them and shake them, they're still coated with milk after I dump the milk out. Every drop is precious.  I'd like fewer parts to deal with. I think it'd be neat to have a manual option included with an electric pump. A variety of nipple attachments for the bottles that are pumped into so I don't have to buy a separate set of feeding bottles. I'd also like those bottles to be glass instead of plastic (or at least have a glass option). I'd like everything to arrive sterilized when I open the box so I don't have to boil it all. The pump system should be closed so there's no risk of mold growing inside- if it's an open system, it should be clean-able. It should last for more than 1 baby, 1 year. I love that this is happening! Pumping is just awful.
