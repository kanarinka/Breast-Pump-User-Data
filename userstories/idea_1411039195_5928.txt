I have the Medela "free Style" breastpump and although It's excellent I would modify the following:

1.- the tote or bag should be a lot smaller.
2.- the sound that the breastpump produces while it is on, it's sometimes annoying.
3.- I am from Chile and I had to buy a huuuge transformer to use it in my country as I bought it in the US. It should come with both type of plugs.
