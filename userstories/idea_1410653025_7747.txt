Would be great if it was something built into a bra that you could wear all day at work and it would either auto pump every x hours or alert you when it is time. It would be so quiet that it could work while you were in meetings or conference calls and no one would hear/ know. It would feel more like breastfeeding and more efficiently remove milk. The milk would gather either be dispensed into container of choice or a camel back like cooler that you empty at the end of day. Is that too much to expect ?
