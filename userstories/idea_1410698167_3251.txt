YES. I would love a cuddly pump. Seriously. A pump you could dress in a clothing item of your child's, and hold close? I clearly remember staring at a picture of my daughter at work and actually murmuring "My baby, my baby" to myself, to help letdown. I would love to be holding something in my arms while engaging in that ritual.
