Hi! I am a mother of two, also a certified lactation counselor. I have a ton of experience with using a breast pump myself, and teaching mothers how to use one! There is one change I would like to see be a universal standard for all breast pumps. Some pumps have a silicone insert that is used to assist with the milk-ejection reflex, and achieving that stage during pumping is critical to pumping success via milk removal. I don't understand why all pumps don't come stock with these pieces, because a soft, malleable silicone massager that mimics baby's gums is so much nicer than a plain, hard piece of plastic. I've worked with tons of moms that had success with these inserts, but they are hard to find, and don't come in universal sizes. Good luck! And thank you to everybody in this team for making maternal and infant health a priority! Great job!
