Hi MIT breast pump organizers,

I'm a new mom 26 years old, in a now one income house. My baby is now 2 mths  3 weeks, I breastfeed and suppliment because I hate the pump. 
My son takes 6 oz if it's a suppliment and if I pump I get 2 oz maybe 4 oz but my issue is that pumps aren't friendly for smaller chested folks I have to lean forward to make the milk fully go down and the milk always gets on my clothes if if isn't all suctioned down. Another problem is the noise infants are so jumpy and I'll try to pump and he'll jump and wake from it. So many parts to clean and having to sit down and be stationary ugh! I walk around from time to time and feed my son and wish that I had that option with a pump especially since when I do pump he's usually down for a nap! Having free hands is a blessing and it sucks sitting there thinking about all I could be doing!

Thanks for searching for a brighter idea
