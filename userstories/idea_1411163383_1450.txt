Reading about your hackathon after waking up to guess what, pump.  Baby is STTN (sleeping through the night, key mom acronym) but I am not due to the need to pump every 5-6 hrs.  Babies can nurse while mom is lying down, but pumps can only be used if mom is vertical (sitting/standing).  How about a pump that lets mom take a catnap?
