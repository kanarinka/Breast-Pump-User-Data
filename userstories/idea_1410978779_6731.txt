Make the tubing shorter and longer at the same time - like expandable/collapsable. It needs to be long enough that your can pump easily and not be attached to the pump, but when you are done pumping, the tubing needs to get smaller and be easier to tame and get out of the way. Currently it gets twisted and is everywhere. I have knocked over fully pumped bottles because the the long twisted up tubing.
