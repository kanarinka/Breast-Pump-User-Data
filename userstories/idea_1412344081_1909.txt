I have paid great attention to the Make the Breast Pump Not Suck Hackathon, though I wish I had known about this form much sooner - I would have submitted before the hack! I am currently breastfeeding my third child while working full time, so have pumped at work for 3 years of my life and still going! Here are some suggestions that I think would greatly improve the pumping experience.
- Storage bags (freezable) should easily attach to the pump but also should be spill proof when removed. There should also be a high capacity option, since some women have larger supplies when pumping begins. It is pretty much impossible to change bags/bottles mid-pump.
- A smaller profile pump is a must - the bag I carry around is ridiculous.
- It should be a hands-free experience.
- It should be easy to sterilize/clean for multiple same day pumping sessions (or come with 2 or 3 of whatever needs to be used each time that requires cleaning). Many women do not have access to a full kitchen at work for these things.
- It should be easily adjustable for varying nipple sizes. I shouldn't have to purchase separate accessories.
- I should be able to put it on in less than 2 minutes and get it off in less than one minute.
