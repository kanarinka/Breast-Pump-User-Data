Suggestion:  Provide a small bag to hold parts.  If it helped dry the parts after use and cleaning, that would be even better.  
Problem:  After pumping while traveling, I have to clean the pump parts in a bathroom (typically) or a sink in a nursing room (rare).  I try to dry them with a hand towel I bring along, but the parts are so small that they don't get completely dry.  I put them in a small make-up bag within the pump and clean the bag about once a week or more frequently if visibly dirty.

Suggestion:  Make pump parts lighter/smaller than the bottles.  
Problem:  When the pump parts are assembled and attached to the bottles, they tip very easily because of their size.  This increases risk of getting them dirty (I've knocked them on the floor many times).  They're especially easy to tip when hooked into the tubes.  It's a balancing act once all is hooked up to not tip or drop anything while putting them on your breast - trying to hold on one and get the other on the other side.

Suggestion:  Build in a small "table top" and "layoff area" within the bag.  
Problem:  Until facilities are able to provide adequate nursing rooms, we're pumping in places like bathrooms while sitting on the toilet.  I've been forced to place full bottles on the ground next to the toilet while putting everything away.  The bag sits nicely on my lap but while putting everything away, there's not enough space for all pieces and parts to avoid putting anything on a gross surface.

Low Priorities:  noise, look/design of the bag
