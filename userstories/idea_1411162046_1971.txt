Hi Breastpump organizers,
I can’t attend (2 kids and live far away). But I own 3 breast pumps and can chime in some feedback. If this is Too Much Info, please then just pass on to the organizers. Thanks for organizing this design meeting as it makes a big difference to working/traveling breastfeeding moms like me who should feel empowered to travel and keep their milk up.
I have a Medela Pump In Style, miPump and a Lansinoh hand pump. I recently traveled overseas twice (for 3 days in Switzerland and 5 days in London respectively) and found that the one that worked best for me was the handpump (Surprise!). The Medela doesn’t operate on 220V. The mPump could be used overseas, but both pumps were noisy and inconvenient. The Lansinoh handpump was the most userfriendly, and I was able to pump on the plane and in public bathrooms discretely and quickly. Also, the pumping action from the pumps were not as efficient over long use— it ended up that I could just squeeze the handpump and give it a long squeeze to be productive rather than needing the active sucking. The handpump was small, didn’t require electronic wires or batteries and had no long tubes getting in the way. I was able to clean it out in the sink and lug it around in my bag during the day of conferences and sightseeing.   Most importantly, it was LIGHTWEIGHT and QUIET in comparison to the other two electronic pumps.

I would recommend designing some better accessories to go with handpumps and traveling, to make it easier to clean on the go, traveling light, storage, and when you have nowhere to really lay things down. It would be nice to have a mesh bag that kept the accessories for cleaning and could be hung up in stalls or clipped onto the shoulder for secure holding and ergonomic use. Anyway, my two cents.
