The Medela Lactina was/is a good pump, just big.  Try to re-create it in a smaller version that is more portable.  We have some of them in our office that are 20 years old and still running great.  It is a very simple design. Also, the Bailey Nurture III is a great little pump but requires some manual work.  Try to make it electronic.  I am SO glad young people are interesting in making a new and improved pump.  You are great! You are awesome!  Go! Go! Go!
