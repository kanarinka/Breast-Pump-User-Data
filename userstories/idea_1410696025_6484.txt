Thank you for the opportunity to give input!! I pump 4+ times a day every day (with a Medela pump in style) and some changes I would like to be considered are: car adapter included with the pump, quieter motor, shorter tubing, hands free option included with the pump, an assortment of samples when purchasing the pump (lanolin, pads etc), compartments in the bag for all of the parts/less parts, a wider range of sizes, an insulated carrying bag for bottles or insulation included in the pump bag. And maybe a way to pump into one bottle/bag with both breasts rather than pumping into two bottles. 
Thanks again!
