Given that milk expression/let down is brought on by biological and psychological cues, it would be great to record the sound of the mom's baby crying or cooing on the machine that she could listen to through headphones. It would also be great to listen to relaxing music through the machine and to have an alarm to let women who are pumping to increase production know when they have pumped for 10 mins etc. because they are often pumping without milk expression (so the body produces more milk) vs. women pumping to collect milk who stop pumping when the milk stops flowing.
