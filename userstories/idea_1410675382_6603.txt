I love the idea of having gentle adhesive (similar to lilypadz, perhaps) soft shield which is rounded, like the Freemie. to be worn under a shirt. A bag collection system that can be concealed under the shirt, and a very quiet, strong portable motor. The rigging involved with the pumps now, and the idea of walking around the house hands-free with them (or at work) is ridiculous, and only semi- effective with a battery pack or the rechargable pumps (which renders the pumps less effective- even the rechargable pumps have less power when not plugged in) With the Pump-in-style backpack it reminds me of the packs worn in Ghostbusters, only humiliating. The harness with the Freestyle is a joke, the bustiers are kind of a hassle-though life-savers for now, and the pumping bras available are often ill-fitting. A pumping system that doesn't look like hospital equipment would be a total bonus, too! This isn't dialysis. 
I'm so glad this project is happening! There is much room for improvement!
