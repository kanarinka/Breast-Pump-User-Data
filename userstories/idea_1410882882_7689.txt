The plastic cone that goes over the nipple should ideally be greased prior to pumping. I know this as the experience is so much more comfortable when I take the time to lube up the plastic; however, I NEVER do this because the time involved to grease and then the additional mess to clean up requires too much from me. Engineers, please solve this problem!
