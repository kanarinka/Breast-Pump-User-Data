There are way too many pumps to wash all the time! It's so loud, so when I was on the phone for conference calls when I went back to work people could hear it in the background. It's not mobile. Moms have to take care of their babies, wash bottles, change diapers, make dinner and do laundry! If we could pump at the same time it would be a life saver!
