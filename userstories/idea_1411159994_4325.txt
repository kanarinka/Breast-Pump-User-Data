I found your work to be fascinating and so important. I have worked extensively with mothers who use breast pumps, have written a small book and a book chapter on the subject and have lectured extensively on this issue. I am a registered nurse and International Board Certified Lactation Consultant and would love to work with you on this project. I have had a number of ideas on how to improve pumps and would gladly share my ideas with you.
