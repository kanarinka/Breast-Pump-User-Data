- Pump should accommodate both a storage bottle and a storage bag. Pouring from one container to another increase risk of spilling! Everyone cries over spilled milk. 
- Pump frequency should be adjustable. I produce more efficiently at a slow rate with my manual pump. 
- It is difficult to center the nipple in the flange! Especially in the dark (nurse baby one side, pump on the other side without turning the lights on too bright). 
- Invisible to others would be a game changer.
