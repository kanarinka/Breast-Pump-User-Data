I want to help with this - I pumped for 4 months after maternity leave, 4x/day at work. Sometimes in the car, too. I wish breast pumps and hands-free bras were one in the same. Would be nice if it was automatically hands-free to use a breastpump without needing another piece of equipment that takes more time to put on/off.
Also of course the noise.
