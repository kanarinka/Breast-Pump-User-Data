First of all, thank you for putting these best and brightest heads together in order to make improvements to this piece of machinery that I both love and hate all at the same time!
I agree about the noise it makes and that you can't always pump in a comfortable position. But beyond that, my biggest gripe is assembling and cleaning and dissembling all the parts. I wish there were a device where one could store the parts in between pumping sessions and they can self sanitize so that they are ready to go for next time.
Also, maximize the effort of the pump so it is extracting as much milk as possible.
If I think of anything more I will reach out again given I use the machine multiple times daily.
Thank you and looking forward to hearing more and hopefully seeing improvements in the near future!
