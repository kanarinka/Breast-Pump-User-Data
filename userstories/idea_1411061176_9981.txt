My baby has at least two "speeds" when he breastfeeds. When there's not much milk coming out, he sucks fast and shallow to stimulate my body to release the milk. When the milk gets released (is "let down"), he sucks long and deep to draw the milk out and swallow it. Then when the milk stops flowing again, he switches back to the fast speed to stimulate another let down.

My breast pump has a fast speed and a slow speed, but it would be nice if:
1) the fast and slow speeds were each adjustable
2) the pump could sense the flow to determine when to switch back and forth from one speed to the other on its own
