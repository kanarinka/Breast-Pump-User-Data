As a working mother of a 29 month old and a 12 week old, both EBF, I've had the opportunity to use three types of medela pumps, freestyle, pump and go, and symphony. Just recently I switched to the freemie for a few reasons. I like that ease of use, putting the collection cups in my nursing bra instead of having to wear the special bra to hold flanges in place. The freemie cups have less parts which help make cleaning easier. I wish there was a solution that included the ease of the freemie cups with the portability of the medela freestyle. I've had to pump in my car more than once and using the charger or a battery pack is a pain. Also, pumping can be a little painful and I'm not sure how to get around that. I have to use a fairly high setting to get the amount of milk I need to pump everyday. Would love to help, maybe critique a prototype, if it would help.
