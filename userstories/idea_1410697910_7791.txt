Now to the connector parts. I hate the connector parts. The Symphony and PIS have ridiculous notches bumps and grooves that just rip into my hands. When its 3am there is high user error and the desire to just get this thing off me. There is a little loop on the connector that is rough and antiquated I know you can do the hairband hack with them but just make them go away. The breast shield now have a speed bump type grove on them I guess to help twist them off the connector but they just hurt. I wish Medela still sold their soft breast shields. I do have the pumping pal breast shields, they are fine, but not a tremendous improvement and with a larger upper lip on the funnel, hard to hand massage while pumping. I get the pop-pop sound a lot from the loss of suction.
