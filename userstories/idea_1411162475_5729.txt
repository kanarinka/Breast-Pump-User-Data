My biggest complaint is that after having a baby your breasts aren't usually pointing straight ahead like the pump is designed for. Breasts are usually engorged and sagging so a pump that had a pivoting angled arm or cup part would be amazing! I have to use one hand to hold my breast up while the other hand holds the pump onto my breast. Which means I'm at the mercy of my toddler  while i sit to pump and have to wait to pump until my 4month old is asleep so I'm not trying to pump with both boys awake. I only pump on occasion like if I'm leaving the boys with daddy so I can go to eat kid free, but if I could make it more comfortable that would be great!
