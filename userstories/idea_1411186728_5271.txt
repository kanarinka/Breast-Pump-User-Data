Four more important ones to supplement previous submission... 

5) *More "direct-to-fridge" receptacle concepts* ....so that moms are pumping directly into storage bags that get quickly sealed, labelled and go directly into fridge or freezer without the messy and risky "transfer" business of pouring the milk from plastic receptacles into storage bags. This would also reduce the cleaning annoyance. Medela makes one such bag but it is terribly designed! It hangs precariously on the this attachment to the valve; the bags frequently rip; and the bags themselves are difficult to seal. Room for improvement!

6)  *Output measurements* - On the milk receptacle, I want a more precise digital milk measurement. The bottles and storage bags are difficult to read and (esp storage bags) leave too much margin of error in determining volume of output from each breast over xx time.

7) *Time/Date Printout functionality on Peel-n-Stick paper* that can be affixed to the milk bags so that moms can avoid the messy business of writing on the bags... which sometimes ends in disaster when the freshly pumped milk gets spilled all over the counter.

8) *Cumulative Time/Date Counter or "Odometer" concept whereby the pump keeps a cumulative running log of all past pumping sessions, date/time, duration, etc.

Think Nike Fuelband for Breast Pumping!
