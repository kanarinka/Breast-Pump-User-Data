Why does it have to feel like you are getting sucked down into the bottle?  Why does it have to be such a hard plastic?Even the units we used on the dairy farm I grew up on looked more comfortable than what I used to pump with.  Could you line the flanges with a silicon type of material that comes off and can be cleaned but makes them more comfortable.  Make the suck cycle more like a suck, swallow, breath of a baby.  Make the units "cute", offer ways that moms can personalize them to make they pretty and look like their own.  It's your "best friend" for hopefully a year, make it a fun friend.
