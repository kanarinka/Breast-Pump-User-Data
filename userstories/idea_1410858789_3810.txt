The breast pump is loud. I would like to be able to pump more unnoticeably. Make a pump that is as silent as possible.  Also, it would be so great if there was a pump you could wear at work that would pump silently and unnoticeably on a timer so you could continue working without interruption. Perhaps it pumps right into a bag strapped on the body someplace. Then, all the action that is needed is unhooking the bag, sealing, and refrigerating at first break opportunity.
