Greetings,
I'm an exclusive pumper. I'm trying to help exclusive pumpers out with some education about how to go about pumping effectively & without hurting themselves. To this end, I have started a website. (It has only been up for a week & I'm still working on it.)

I would like you to have a look at it to see some of the challenges that EP'ers face in learning how to pump long-term. I would also like to draw your attention to the BabyCenter Community Group - The Exclusive Pumpers for a wider view of the day-to-day lives of women who depend on breastpumps.

I hope both these resources gives you some good ideas of what women want & need from a device that becomes their second baby in addition to all the other suggestions.

My website is www.happycowtips.ca & the Baby Center Community Group is www.community.babycenter.com/groups/a4592405/the-exclusive-pumpers (disclaimer: I was voted in to be one of the Group Owners by the group).

While I do hope my website becomes helpful for many women, I'm only planning on maintaining it for a year at most. The BabyCenter Community Group will likely last much much longer.

I would like to keep certain features of some existing pumps, namely, the solid & impermeable barrier like that in Ameda HygieniKits. I prefer having a closed system with a solid barrier that is repeatably sterilizable & is before the tubing so tubing never needs cleaning.

I would like flanges to be perfectly clear, as in transparent, again. This makes it much easier to identify letdowns & check on nipple health during pumping.

Thank you for listening.
