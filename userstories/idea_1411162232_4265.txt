Thank you for taking the initiative to make pumping a better experience.  One idea I have is to create a good, long-lasting pump that could be shared, and then all moms would have to do would be to plug in their own attachments.  That would at least be one less thing to carry.  For workplaces that have a dedicated mothers room it could just stay plugged in all the time and would not need to worry about charging.  I currently use a Medela Freestyle.  I haven't tried any others so I have nothing to compare it to.   I've done okay with supply-I pump 25minutes, twice a day.  I save time cleaning by just throwing everything in the dishwasher.  However, it still takes a fair amount of time just to take everything apart and put it back together again.  I hope you generate some great ideas.
