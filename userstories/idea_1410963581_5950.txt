To not have milk go anywhere but in the bottle/bag that it is pumped to. Not on the breast shields where it can leak out during the transition from pumping to detaching.

To make the transition from attaching to pumping at the breast go more smoothly. It is a balancing act because you can't let go until the suction is there.

Good luck!
