Hi, I saw somewhere online that you are working on how to improve upon the current common breast pumps available to us pumping moms, another hack event scheduled this month like one you did last May or so.  I thought I would respond to the email address left for response to the May event.

I wanted to send along my 2 cents. Here we are, now able, many of us, to get free pumps through the healthcare act. With it, so much waste because the covered pumps are all single use, open system pumps. Why are we not making all pumps closed system pumps at this point in time. I'm supposed to throw out my 2 pumps when I'm done with them? The amount of waste here is mind boggling. So can we cheaply make closed system pumps? This way women could sell, loan out or give away their pumps when they are done with them. 

Another thought, many of us ladies have no way of testing our pumps to make sure, periodically that the suction and motor are working properly. Often we think there is something wrong with our own bodies, like we are drying up, when it could be the motor slowly dying or other part failures. Could there be a way to build in some self diagnosis to the system? something that would let us know if the motor is not performing at the correct levels.

I'm a part of a great Facebook support group for breastfeeding mothers (Breastfeed Chicago!) that has members all over the U.S.. Some of us are exclusive pumpers, some of us pump part time at work. We are currently 8,631 women strong. If you ever need a survey group or a population of users to bounce something off of, we are diverse and engaging group with lots of opinions to share. We'll eagerly be watching for the results from this latest hack event.
