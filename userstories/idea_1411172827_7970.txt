My Wishlist:

1. A smart pump. The pump should tell me when is the best time to pump to maximize milk output. It should get to know my body - the best time of day to pump, how much I pumped in the last session, how long I should wait between sessions, 
2. Make a pump that is perfectly silent. My days are crammed with phone meetings. It is incredibly hard to find time to pump, and sometimes I have to miss sessions. I would be so much more productive if I could pump while on calls.
3. Make a pump that works while I sleep!!! I'm exhausted. I force myself to stay up most nights so I can pump a bit of extra milk for my daughter. Having a few extra ounces on hand helps me keep my sanity because it means I can take a break and go to a yoga class or do something for me. Further, if I could pump while I slept, I could tap into the body's nautural rhythms for producing milk (it seems like I produce more at night).
4. Make a pump that offers some privacy. I was at a convention yesterday in downtown Boston, and I needed to pump on my drive home. I don't do this often, but I was desperate. I sat in the parking lot, hooking myself up to my hands free pump bra. Then I looked up and realized 6 guys were getting into the car next to me. I started driving and the entire convention of 10,000 people walked out. I tried to cover myself up, and as much as I've gotten to the point where I don't really care who sees me, it still felt humiliating. 

Thank you for doing this!
