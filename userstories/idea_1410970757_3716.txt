- Portable, battery-powered motor (think: Medela Freestyle) that can be worn with a belt clip.
- Cup-like flanges that can be worn under your clothes (think: Freemies), without the need for a special hands-free (i.e., Simple Wishes) pumping bra - Quiet motor
-Tubing that can also be worn under clothing

If these four things could be combined, then I coudl theoretically clip my pump onto my pants, run the tubing up underneath my shirt, stick the flanges in my bra, and go about my business!  Importnatly, I could 
- Attend meetings and not have to (i) explain to clients or my male co-workers that I need to use the phone to call into a meeting that is taking place just 10 feet outside my office door; (ii) put said phone on mute whenever I'm not speaking to mask the sound of my pump; and (iii) I can actually walk around hte office (go to the printer, photocopier, get water, warm up my lunch in the microwave) and not be in hiding/chained to my desk.

Also, as many working mothers will attest, in addition to pumping at work, I needed to pump during the night and on the weekends in order to have enough milk to send to daycare.  That means that I needed to find roughly 30 minutes each night, and twice on weekends, to pump.  In case you've never tried to pump while watching an active infant -- plugged into the wall, with the flanges and bottles and tubing hanging off of you, with a baby who wants to climb on you, climb on everything else in the room, pull the tubing off and eat it, need its diaper changed, etc. -- it's impossible. 

Furthermore, I know several women who exclusively pump, for a variety of reasons including because breastfeeding was painful / baby could not properly latch.  For an exclusively pumping mom, this would actually make pumping and taking care of the baby at the same time manageable.  It's one thing to nurse in public -- it's become fairly socially acceptable and a lot of moms are comforgable doing it, whether with or without a nursing cover.  It's another thing to pull down your shirt, have to strap on a hands-free bra, hook up flanges and bottles, and sit still for 30 minutes pumping when you're out at a restaurant, the mall, or wherever. I am fairly certain that most pumping moms would be humiliated to pump in public. (Note, I am not saying that they should be: I am a big proponent of doing whatever you want to do to feed yoru baby, wherever you want to do it.  That doesn't change that I think most women woudl be embarrased by having to hook up thiese ancient contraptions for all the world to see).

Thank you for doing this. Taking care of an infant is challenging enough; breastfeeding really adds another layer to that, especially when mom goes back to work.  It's easy to feel like we are a slave to the pump, always having to find the time (what new mom has time?) and a private place to tuck away.  Having a pump that is unobtrusive and can be used wherever, whenever, would truly be life changing.
