The noise! If you could make it so that my entire office doesn't know that I'm pumping, if be grateful!  Also, because I tend to freeze the milk that I pump (rather than use it immediately) I hold a bag onto the pump part (flange?) rather than using the threads to screw a bottle onto the flange. Needless to say, this often ends with either hand cramps or spilled milk. Any good way to affix a bag so that it can stay on the flange and I don't have to hold it the entire time I'm pumping?
