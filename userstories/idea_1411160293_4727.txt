Hi! 
The Breast pump seriously needs an update, so I thought it really great to see others  think the same. 
My suggestions would be:

1. Have the Flange shaped like a babies mouth. It sounds weird but if you look at the way a baby latches it is not shaped like the flanges.

2. Include movement in the flange itself. The babies tongue moves along with the jaw to help get the milk out. The breast pump does not do that at all. 

3. Include constant suction that you can adjust. For me the intermittent suction does not stimulate let down because my baby has constant suction. 

Really it is the combination of 2. and 3. that would be most effective imo. 

Those are the biggest things for me. I really would spend a fortune on one that actually efficiently pumped breast milk. 

Happy engineering!
