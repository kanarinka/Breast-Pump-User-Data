-I really wish that the cups weren't freezing cold when you first start pumping... This definitely doesn't help the milk start flowing.
-I would love to be able to pump laying down... Or to pump and have the milk run down into the bottle (not on my breast in the cup).. My medela pump forces me to lean way forward to let the milk fall which hurts your back and neck.
-I would love I have a car power attachment.
-I would love to have a quiet pump that won't wake my family up or disturb workmates.
