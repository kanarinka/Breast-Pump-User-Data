Comfortable where your forearm holds it. I get lines from where my Ameda hits my arm so I'm constantly adjusting. 

Rechargeable battery pack. 

This sounds impossible, but being able to lay down/fall asleep while pumping would be amazing. Whether it's on stomach or back. 

Built-in timer/shut off switch. Adjustable time of course. 

Come in fun colors/designs. Matching parts/bags.
