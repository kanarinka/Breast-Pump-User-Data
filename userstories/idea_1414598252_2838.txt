Hello just wanted to give you a quick heads up. The words in your article seem to be running off the screen in Internet explorer. I'm not sure if this is a format issue or something to do with internet browser compatibility but I figured I'd post to let you know. The layout look great though! Hope you get the problem resolved soon. Many thanks
