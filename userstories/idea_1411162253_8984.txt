1.  Make a closed system that actually has suction.  I used an Ameda Purely Yours and loved the fact that milk never got in the tubes; but hated that it had terrible suction.  Now I have to buy a Medela Pump In Style b/c all my friends rave about how it gets all your milk out; but have to worry about keeping all the parts clean (especially the tubing).  

That's really it.  I'm so happy you all are taking this on as a project and hopefully the breastpump companies will listen to you.  If you need support getting change made - check out The Leaky Boob on FB - she's a HUGE breastfeeding supporter, having breastfed her 6 children.  Yes, 6.  

Thank you
