I would love to be able to lean back and rest during middle of the night pumping sessions.  If the horns had a slight angle to them that would allow me to lean back rather than forward, it would be great.  Also, a smaller and more portable pumping mechanism would be ideal- i hate having to lug my giant pump bag to and from work every day.
