The breastpump kit flanges should be soft flexible material not hard plastic.
The breastpump kit should fit more like a bra so that you don't have to hold it in position.
There should be more sizes for the flanges to accomodate maternal anatomy.
There should be fewer parts with built in valves and filters.
