Breast pumps need to have more variations in size and shape. Every breast is different...sometimes even the same woman can have two very differently shaped or sized breasts and breast pumps are not made to accommodate those needs. Also, portability is a major issue. Yeah, they make bras that you can strap a pump into, but have you ever used one? They're a nightmarish pain in the rear end! We need a pump that has some kind of comfortable neck and back strap so we can hook up and get some stuff done! Lastly, breast pumps should mimic the suckling motion of an infant a little more accurately so the breasts aren't getting rubbed raw by these plastic tubes they're squeezing into. I hope this helps becausebreast pumps these days suck!
