Let mom pump from a more reclined position

Don't make mom need a table -- pump should be manageable from seated position even when pump is on floor

Give mom room to do something with her hands in front of her while pumping (i.e. eating, typing) -- current designs take up too mush space in front, make me keep my arms out wide to side

Remember mom's "settings"
