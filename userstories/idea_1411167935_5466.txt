I want to point out the theost effective pump currently is out of production, the medela classic. Can you guys hack one and figure out how to re-engineer it's effectiveness? Is it just a level of suction issue, or is it something different about the piston mechanism?

Also, could there be a flatter flange system that slipped into a normal bra with separat suction and collection hoses coming out of it. Think something the shap of a breast shield.
