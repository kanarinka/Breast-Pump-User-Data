A few points on how the breastpump needs to improve from an extensive user who continues to breastfeed twins who are now 2y9m old. 
Background: They were born in Dec 2011, healthy but 5 weeks premature. I received excellent peri-natal care, especially at a Breastfeeding and Newborn Assessment clinic where lactation consultants helped me track feedings to shift gradually from some to no formula and constant to no pumping. http://www.stjoes.ca/health-services/women-s-infants-/breastfeeding-newborn-assessment-clinic

I fed them every 3 hours: directly on the breast solo and later together followed bottle-feeding top-ups one at a time then pumping to stimulate their demand. Read: extreme sleep deprivation! It was tough to not skip the pumping and irritating that the steps of setting-up, labelling and washing after took time. I taped the flanges to my breasts so I could get things done: this was my only 1/2 hour to eat, make phone calls, etc. while pumping. I then slept 1/2 hour to start again. It took 21/2 hours out of a 3 hour cycle! (I skipped one feeding cycle every 24 hours for one "long" 3 hour sleep to sustain this insane schedule.)

What was awesome:
- the municipal public health clinic lent me their double, industrial pump which is the way to go
- tracking
- support. I didn't even have time to analyze my data but the LCs at the clinic did.
- the screw-on containers were seemless from pump to screw-on nipple.  

What needs to improve: 
- Neo-natal intensive care units (NICU) provide tilt-back comfy chairs = wrong! I longed for a tilt-forward massage chair ideally complete with a tray for my laptop, all plugged in so I could be productive while pumping!

- Mobility. I was in the NICU for a month, sleeping in a bunk room, the pump room was off to the side for privacy but there and at home I wanted mobility. The pump bra looks promising. Never got a chance to buy one. Risk of pumps banging into things needs to be addressed. How about a battery back-pack. The double-industrial is a must but it needs to be made mobile.

- Flanges do not fit everyone. Room for improvement here.

- Look at the whole picture of direct feeding to top-ups to pumping, repeat *8/24 hours and improve the ease of flow and reduce the work overall. Maybe an automatic mini-dishwash sterilizer you can just throw the flange and small pieces in to between cycles? Storage in pre-labelled bottles. 

- I love the image of eating and pumping or directly feeding twins. When my supply seemed low, I ate everything in sight. Without time to sleep this is the best I could do. 

- Pumps are too expensive and it is a waste that they cannot be re-sold or safely passed on. The double-electric could though, without the tubing, right? Fix this.
