1. Something that's not so cumbersome to carry and put together, and clean!
2. How awesome would it be if there was a way to hook up to a pump you could wear while sleeping that automatically started pumping at a set time in the middle of the night when our prolactin level is high?! 
3. Softer flanges. Boobs are soft. Babies' mouths are soft. Why can't the flange be soft?!
4. The ability to control the speed would be awesome. More than two speeds ideally. 
5. Tubes are annoying. Can't we come up with another way to get the suction accomplished?
