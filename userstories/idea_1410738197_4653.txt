As a first time mom, my baby was not the best eater at the beginning and he was on a 2 hour eating schedule (at most! Sometimes he wanted to eat again after 1.5 hours). It would take him at least 20 minutes I each side to nurse (40 minutes total). If I then tried to pump for 20 minutes as was recommended by lactation consultants, then disassemble & clean all the pieces which took another 15-20 minutes. I literally had 10-40 minutes without anything attached to my breasts. It was exhausting and emotionally draining and kind of horrible. I was not able to sustain that schedule so I continued to breastfeed but gave up pumping except when away from my baby for business trips. Because of this I believe my supply was never very good. If my pump had more suction, making it quicker AND had fewer, easier to clean parts, I would have been able to do it more often increasing my supply and negating the need for formula supplementation.
