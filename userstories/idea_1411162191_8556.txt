First of all, I would like to say how excited I am about this project you are working on!  I help organize similar competitions on Duke’s campus and the breast pump is a topic near and dear to my heart so I can’t wait to see what your students come up with.
 
One thing students may want to consider in the design.  I own a Medela pump and the thing that has always driven me bonkers about its design are the endless nooks and crannies located in the connectors.  It makes it impossible to get 100% clean and it always starts to look grungy after a few months of use.  I almost wonder in Medela purposefully designs the connector this way to encourage you to buy new ones.  The second thing I have never understood is why the yellow membrane connector just sits on the connector the way it does.  The first time you take it off it never sits correctly again.  This means you lose suction power which is of course frustrating.  What would be smart is if they designed this part to screw onto the connector like a bottle cap.  This way you could easily screw it on and off when you needed to clean the inside of the connector.  Just a thought!
