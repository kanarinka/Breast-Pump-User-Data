Retractable tubing would be great! If it retracted into a self-sealing/self-sanitizing compartment; even better!

Built in hooks to hang flanges from bra strap to hold them up until you can get the pump turned on & in place once you start pumping.

Thank you so much for doing this! I hope you do it every year. Let us know if we need to push Medela (and others) to buy your prototypes etc to get your improvements into the hands of the mommies!!!
