Just the other day I was feeding and pumping at the same time. I had just gotten off of work and my husband tries to hold out on giving my little Oliver a bottle if I'm around 15 mins from being home. We love our time together but he absolutely hates hearing the pump,  it's so loud.  My baby boy is almost 4 months so if he's hating the loud pump now I can only imagine him getting more frustrated with it the older he gets. I'd also like to see the pump become more discrete and efficient.  Why not make it mimic the way a baby nurses?  The sucking just isn't working.  As a busy working mom (oh how I'd love to say home with my children) time matters, and spending 15-20 minutes sitting attached to a pump to get a whole 3 maybe 4 ounces isn't working for me. It takes so much determination to keep at it as I have. So as a mom I'd love to see a new design with the outdated pumps.
