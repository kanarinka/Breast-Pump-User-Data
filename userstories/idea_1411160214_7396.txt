So, my idea re: how to make breastpumps better deals in making the actual pumping motion more similar to how a baby drinks from a breast.  Right now, we're putting relatively inflexible plastic shields over the breast and using a vaccum to suck out milk, and to press the breast tissue against the plastic, which pushes the milk out.  That works okay for a lot of women, but a baby (well, not a newborn, but a baby who knows what it's doing and isn't terrible at breastfeeding) is always significantly faster/gets a lot more milk out than a pump.  And there are still women for whom a pump does nothing.

I'm picturing, instead of those firm plastic shields, something more like a balloon.  Still a cup shape, but made of pockets that could inflate and deflate rhythmically, to better mimic the motion that a baby's mouth and tongue make when nursing.  It would have to fit pretty well over the breast, and there's the problem of breasts deflating as the milk is expressed to deal with, and I don't know how to resolve that--but that's why I'm sending the idea to you, rather than fashioning my own breastpump!  

I think the main problem with pumping is that it takes so long for so many women, and it can be extremely discouraging.  You just can't take a thirty minute break every two hours to pump! My 18 month old can empty a painfully full breast in under ten minutes, often five.  A pump takes half an hour to empty a full breast, and the breast never, never gets as empty.  If you can make it faster by making the actual sucking mechanism more similar to a baby's mouth, it could not just make pumping more convenient for working women, but make it possible where before it was impossible.  

This is a great mission, though, and I was super excited to read about it!
