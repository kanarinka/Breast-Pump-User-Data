1) Flanges that don't have small holes which can't be easily cleaned with a sponge or bottle brush. I noticed mold beginning to grow in the creases on the interior of the L shaped piece (Medela and Hygeia flanges) if I did not scrub them each time with a tiny brush. 
2) Compression/massage of the whole breast  (not just the areola/nipple) to encourage more efficient milk flow and allow the process to actually be hands free. This could actually be with a massaging bra, rather than the flange.
