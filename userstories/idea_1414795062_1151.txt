A sleeping pump! 

So many babies are unable to latch properly or stay awake for regular feedings, meaning moms have to feed, pump and still find time to sleep themselves. The sleeping pump would allow mom to lay down, and would collect the milk in pouches that rest gently on her side. The pump turns off automatically after 20 minutes, and when mom wakes up for the next feeding she already has milk to store, and can get an extra half hour to hour of sleep for every feeding, which in my case would have been 4 or 5 times a night!
