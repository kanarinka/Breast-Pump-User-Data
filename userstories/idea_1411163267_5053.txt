A pump that has a silicone flange and massage rollers underneath to massage the breast and better mimic the baby’s tongue movements.
 
·         Have a silicone end that suctions on around the areola (where baby’s mouth would be) like the body suction cups used for therapy. http://www.amazon.com/traditional-especially-unbreakable-extra-thick-self-massage/dp/B00847FS80

·         Massage rollers that rotate (user can adjust speed) to compress the lactiferous sinuses allowing less (if at all) motor suction and better mimics the baby’s tongue movements or breast compression.  (don’t they make some sort of sex toy like this?? LOL!).  The flange would be partially (or completely) made of silicone to allow full cleaning.

·         Separating diaphragm (like the Ameda pumps) that COMPLETELY remove the need for any filters or any possible contamination.
