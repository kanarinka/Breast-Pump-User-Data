The pump flanges need to be flexible and soft like silicone.  It is important for the design to have gentle compressions a bit further onto the breast (about 2-3 inches around nipple) as well.  Ideally, breast pumps should be very quiet and equipped with a rechargeable battery since a lot of women have to pump in places without an electrical outlet. Also, it would be great to have it hands-free and also made to where women can sit up straight and pump instead of having to hunch forward to allow the milk to flow into the bottle. A bonus would be for breast pumps to be easy to clean or to not have as many parts to clean.
