I usually hand express after pumping -- so do many moms I know. But hand expressing into the pump flanges results in one-handed-expressing and lots of mess. Look at this video: http://ammehjelpen.no/handmelking?id=907. At the very beginning you'll see a container that seems to stand alone and it allows the woman to use both hands. If something like this were included in pumps (perhaps made out of silicone so it could be squished while being stored) women might actually be able to get enough milk for babies.
