I think if people were generally happy with the products available, you would not being so much interest in and input for the "hackathon."  The current products are by and large old, out dated, time consuming, bulky, inefficient, expensive, excessively complicated, painful, and very NOT user friendly. So no, maybe not terrible by definition. But there is lots and lots of room for innovation and improvements!
