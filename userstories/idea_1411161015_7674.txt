greetings!
I saw your blog  (https://medium.com/@medialab/513fad8bc451)and LOVED this  idea. I am a working nursing mom of twin infants, and so much of my life revolves around pumping. I love the idea of making pumping not suck!
Some ideas I have are:
1. including a timer or clock on the pump itself (most moms I know pump for a predetermined amount of time)
2. have the "priming" cycle automatically kick in after a predetermined amount of time to mimic baby nursing cycles/letdown
3. make the tubing that runs from pump to hard plastic parts be retractable into the pump itself to they don't get tangled/contaminated
4. if the pump were a "smart pump" it would be able to log the frequency and duration of each pumping session, and then log that info into some type of app (sidenote: I have yet to find a good app for logging my output)
5. all pumps should be the quality of a hospital grade pump. I get a noticeable improvement from the hospital pump vs the travel pump.

Would any outsiders be allowed to attend the fall hackathon? I would love to get involved with this. (My background is in life sciences and I have an MBA.) And I am writing this email as I pump....
