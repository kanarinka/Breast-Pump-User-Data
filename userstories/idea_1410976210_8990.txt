It would be awesome if the pump did more than just suck. Often Mom's have to physically massage the breasts to help empty the milk ducts when pumping....maybe a pump/flange piece that would compress/massage the entire breast, rather than current pumps that only target the nipple area. It may help exclusive pumping Mom's to increase production and help to more effectively empty the milk!
