A quieter motor so if I'm working from home, I can be on a conference call inconspicuously?
Any way to have it work when I'm not in a sitting position?
Any way to have it more closely mimic a newborn's compression and sucking mechanism?
Wish there were fewer parts (there are a lot of pieces to keep track of and clean every time)
A way to NOT have to sanitize after EVERY use?
Please make it lighter for working moms to carry to work!  Even the lightest one is still the weight of a laptop, and I carry this in addition to my regular "work bag" every day...for months.
