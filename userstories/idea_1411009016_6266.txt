If love to see a pump that mimics the peristaltic motion of a baby's tongue rather than traditional flanges.  

The ability to focus the pump on certain areas to help with clearing clogged ducts would be very helpful.

Adjustable flange sizes

Materials other than plastic would be wonderful, especially as we are learning more and more about the potentially hazardous chemicals present in all plastics (even those that are BPA free).  I'm not sure what material would make a good substitute, but I'm thinking about glass (like the kind Pyrex uses) or silicone would be a good place to start.

A reminder, written somewhere on the pump, that the volume of milk expressed with a pump is NOT indicative of a mother's actual milk supply!

Greater portability:
Less bulk
Wireless
Ability to clip the pump onto pants and walk around while pumping
Pump parts that puzzle together with the actual pump unit
Retractable tubing
Rechargeable battery
Fewer pieces to assemble at each pumping session (seriously, it would shave 5 minutes off of my pumping time if I didn't have to assemble and disassemble so many parts!)
