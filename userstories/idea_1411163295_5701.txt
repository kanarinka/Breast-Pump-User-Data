If the portions connected to the breast had flexible material much like the commercial nippleshields, but were two pieces which meshed together similar to vocal folds, couldn't there be similar movement to vocal folds and infant sucking? One edge to the middle to the back?
If that was encased inside of the more traditional housing for the breast now, couldn't that potentially invoke the bernouli effect and cause a wave like motion to occur allowing the breast to stimulate milk production? 
I would love to hear what you think and would be extremely interested in helping with this if it was a possibility.
