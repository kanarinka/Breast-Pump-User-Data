I LOVE this project (especially as I sit here pumping :/ ) as a midwife, I recommend and write prescriptions for them all the time knowing full well it's a bad product though necessary.

Other than the issues you explored already, breastpumps are single-person use. The rationale the company gives is horrible (you can't use someone else's pumps because the inner workings become moldy and that's unhealthy/unsanitary for baby). Wouldn't I be making my own device mold over the course of the year of my own personal use? If it's unhealthy/unsanitary, shouldn't there be a way to clean it? Why (if not for purely greedy reasons- they want to maintain a market for the item) are the pumps available to the public open systems that can get moldy? Why can't all pumps be either closed systems or easily washable?

Pumps are currently super wasteful. Pumps are potentially/probably unsanitary (according to the manufacturers own logic). There has to be a solution.
