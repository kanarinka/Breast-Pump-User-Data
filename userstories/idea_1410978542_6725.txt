As a currently pumping mom, here are some things I'd love to see. Easier to carry/lighter; quicker to set up and take apart; not requiring you to lean forward to avoid milk flowing back on you; easier to center flanges (hard to center, especially when pumping in the dark and if they're not centered, you can get sore spots on your nipples where they rub); better options for collecting the milk (plastics have issues but there really are no other options at the moment)

Thank you for tackling this project! I can't tell you how big of a difference a better breast pump would make to the quality of my own life right now, and I know it would be the same for other mothers who come after me.
