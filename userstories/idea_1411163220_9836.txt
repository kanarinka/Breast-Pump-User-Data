I just stumbled upon your hackathon website.  Ironically I was just talking with my Midwife at MIT Medical during a prenatal visit about technologies that hadn't change in quite some time, and how what I'd really like to see is a better breast pump.

As I see it is the major problem is that the primary mechanism for milk removal using a breast pump is vacuum.  The primary mechanism a baby uses is compression.  Though both can be used to remove milk, compression is a heck of a lot more comfortable then stretching your nipples to disturbingly long lengths into a tube.  It's a lot less likely to crack or rub your nipples too.  Compression is also the major mechanism used when hand expressing milk (you just kind of squeeze the milk glands and milk will squirt out).  For a minute or two, most mom's could probably get just as much, if not more milk, by hand expression... but hands get tired quickly.  And "hands-free" is obviously pretty much a requirement to working mothers, who usually prefer to work (or at least eat lunch) while pumping.

If you can figure out how to replicate an infant's breast compressing motion without the use of high vacuum, you could design a much more comfortable (and effective) breastpump.
