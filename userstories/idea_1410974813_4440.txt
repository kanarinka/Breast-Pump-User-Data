Being able to be mobile-- smaller motor, not plugged into the wall. Maybe even a motor that can clip on or stap around your waist? Not having the motor attached to the bag. Many companies sew them in so if you want to bring your pump with you, you must carry around the giant taupe rectangle, as I call mine. I'd prefer not to keep my pump parts and bottles in their bag anyway- I like to use my own bags. Plus its not at all stylish and a dead give away that you're a new mom (to other new moms I guess- I can identify a pump from across a room.)
Quieter motor so that if someone is nearby, or you want to talk on the phone, they can't hear the loud whir of the machine.
Being able to pump more discreetly if in public-- so smaller breast shieds that would fit under clothing or a cover.
Making it hands free. There are hands free pumping bras you can buy for like $30-40, but my question is who WOULDNT want to have the use of their hands. Let's just go ahead and make that part of the pump set up. 
Not having to take it apart and put it back together EVERY SINGLE time. Setting it up, including plugging it in, inserting the tubes, putting together the bottles, filters and breastshieleds-- and then taking it all apart and cleaning it after-- that takes a bunch of time.
