First - THANK YOU. You had me swooning at "investigating creative solutions for the maternal and neonatal healthcare space." I'm a mother to two young children, I work full time in tech, and I've logged many hours on a breast pump. 

Ideas: 
1 - All the washing is exhausting. Can we use materials that are (a) antibacterial in nature (b) less prone to collect bacteria? 

2 - Often milk gets clogged into tubing unless one is able to mind the rules of gravity rather strictly, which one is not when pumping on the go. Can we (a) make it easier to clean tubes when this happens, and (b) reduce the risk of this happening by bettering the suction process? 

3 - Cost. Can we select materials that help lower the cost? 

4 - enhance timing and pressure customization. Perhaps savable settings for each boob? Savble settings based on time available. As in "a quick ten minute pump before this meeting" and a "my first pump of the morning which takes 25 minutes."

5 - Better battery options when a plug in isn't available. 

6 - collection bottles that are self-contained/closing. Meaning, often when removing the collection bottle milk spills in the process of getting the damn thing off your boob and off the elbow joint. Can some kind of prefabricated, attached, interior lid of cover system help prevent that?
