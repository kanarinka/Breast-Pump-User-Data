- make it possible to pump while laying down
- change the shape and material of the flanges, hard plastic hurts
- more variation on speed, suction
- allow for different speed and suction on each side
- bulit usb charger
- quiet pump (least of my concerns but i figured i would mention it)

Thank you for goving me the opportunity to give my ideas.
