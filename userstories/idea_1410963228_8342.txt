1. Hands free would be amazing. Yes, there are bras, but another thing to keep up with, really?? Why cant they just 'stick' to you!? also- spill proof- i've spilt milk out of the breather hole at the top while trying to bend over to pick something up while pumping. 2. Could they pump into one container? -Less parts to clean.   3. Glass parts? Less BPA & Plastic? I store my pumped milk in a glass spaghetti jar. 4. Easy clean lines. I've gone through two sets of medela pump tubing in 10 months because you cannot clean it well. A brush small enough to clean inside the tip with the insert on it would help. Even the Dr. Browns bottle brush is too large to fit in the end with the insert on the tubing. Steam bag cleaning doesn't work. and twirl mine around above my head, (Yes, i've hit myself, lol) to get the condensation out, and hang to dry after each pumping ---still doesnt help.
