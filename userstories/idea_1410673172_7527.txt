Milk often leaks down the plastic breastshields/funnels when I use the pump sitting up straight. To stop wastage, I lean over, torso parallel to the floor, so that milk drips directly into the funnel. It's no fun and it makes my back hurt. But every drop counts, especially for women with low-average levels of milk! Perhaps you could develop a seal over the funnel made out of a material that adheres more closely to skin, such as silicon or rubber, to stop leakage (similar to the way a baby's mouth seals over the breast).
