Basically, when I used one, I felt like a cow.  Any machine that doesn't make me as though I'm a cow would be preferable.  The suction is super painful.  I understand that the machines are designed to "pull" as much as possible in order to get the maximum amount, but it was definitely a painful deterrent to pumping.
