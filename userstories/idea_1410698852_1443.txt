There's a brand available that I can tell nobody in here has heard of that has a hospital grade pump for $240 just as good as the Medela symphony. We sell loads of them hospitals and professionals here in Australia. Id prefer not to mention it by name but it is there if you search. Absolutely and truly every bit as effective and with a stack of innovations.
