Comfort, please!
Easier to disassemble and clean (fewer grooves).  Imagine yourself using at a small office desk.  You have binders, papers, a keyboard around you. You now have to put away milk, disassemble pump and clean in less than 3 minutes before your next meeting.
Quieter--again, imagine using this in *your* office
