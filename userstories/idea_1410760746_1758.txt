It's so noisy!! The air pump on my aquarium is quieter and it runs 24/7. When I take conference calls in my office and have to pump at the same time, I just tell the people it's the printer in my office. Anyway. I'm usually pumping between meetings. I'm lucky enough to have an office and a desk to myself, so what I really like to do is just set the bottles on my desk and kind of lean forward into the flanges. I HATE that there's no way to support them. I end up putting my arm on top to keep them from falling. I'm not going to take the time to swap in and out of a pumping bra every time, but if there was some kind of desk stand or clamp on the side of my desk to hold the bottle still for me, I'd love that. Then I could answer email while pumping instead of surfing the internet or playing Candy Crush, which is all I can manage one-handed.
