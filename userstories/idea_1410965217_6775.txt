Moore's Law for breast pumps! Each year breast pumps should be smaller, lighter, and more effective. 
Please make it less like a machine and more like a baby. Pumping never quite removes all the milk the way my baby does, so by the end of the day I'm engorged. I would love to have a pump that is gentle--perhaps softer plastic--silicone? And less parts, please! I hate lugging around the various pieces. While we're dreaming, please make it self cleaning.
