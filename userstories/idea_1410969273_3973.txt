Pumps have too many parts! I'm a teacher, so when I pump during the work day I'm leaving my class with a paraprofessional. God bless her, but I don't want to have to prepare activities for her to do, twice a day for 20+ minutes at a time! So, by the time I get it all set up and the parts cleaned in usually stressed and rushing to get back to my room. I know that isn't healthy. Help make it quick and easy! Less parts.
