Please keep in mind that the women who have the hardest time pumping are moms who work as nurses, as teachers, in factories, in manufacturing, in retail, at restaurants, and in cubicles.  Also, pumping for a baby when you are home with other young children (imagine toddlers and preschoolers running around) is also a challenge.  It is very important that there is a silent, mobile, hands free, easy to use, easy to clean breast pump that is affordable and very reasonably priced.  It would be awesome if pumping while walking/moving and while driving could be easy to do.
