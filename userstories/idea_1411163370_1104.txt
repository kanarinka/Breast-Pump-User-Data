I was so excited when I heard about the breast pump hackathon!! I wrote ups few ideas over a couple days as I thought of them. I'm sure other moms are thinking the same, but figured I would email them your way in case any are unique:

- Make it a closed system so tubing can't mold (like Ameda purely yours is closed)

- Have various types of suction patterns (I believe Medela has this)

- Make it fit into a quick to use hands free bra like simple wishes brand

- Make the flanges/cups low profile (easier to pump discretely AND smaller to store) like Freemies, though they could still have bottles attach to them

- Build it so you can leave most parts assembled and not have to take it out of the bag (unless you figure out a way to do my crazy idea below!)

- Add something that mimics the lower jaw motion that massages to work together with the suction

- Make the motor/suction as quiet as possible so it's a bit more discrete

- make all parts BPA free (and anything else 'free') since the milk goes to a baby who should get as few toxins as possible

- this is my crazy out of the box idea. I'm lucky enough to have an employer that provides space and allows me to take breaks, but for some jobs like teachers or truck drivers, it's really hard to fit in pumping. It would be AWESOME if there's a way to make it so discrete that you can wear it all the time and it works like a mic that has a battery pack and you can switch it on and off. Maybe the tubing drains into a bag (that's can't leak) and since breastmilk can stay out 5 hours, it gives you quite a long time before you'd have to change the bag out. Just make it easy to change the bag without having to undress! It would also be great for moms who exclusively pump!! Maybe they put it on before bed and sleep with it, then they can pump super easily in the middle of the night.
