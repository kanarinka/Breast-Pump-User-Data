In addition to the pump, there are also the 'extras' that go along with it - pads to put in your bra, nursing bras, certain types of clothing, etc. I think it's important for the pump design to take these things in to consideration too. Can a pump be made to work with all clothing, so you don't have to change your attire while pumping/nursing? I find the pads to be a necessity but a real pain - they shift, the sticky side is against my skin half the time, they fall out while I'm nursing. Can there be an integral pad to the pump components?
