I need to pump at work. Right now, I have to find a space to go to for privacy (NOT a bathroom). I have to use my break times to pump and can't get work done while I'm pumping. My dream pump would be totally (or nearly) silent, I would be able to pump with my shirt on so I could work at my desk and pump at the same time and no one would be the wiser.
