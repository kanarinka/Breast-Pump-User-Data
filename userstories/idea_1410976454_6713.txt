Breast pumps should mimic how a baby feeds. If you can follow a swallow study on an infant that would help. For me I notice that baby's tongue/mouth touches the nipple and areola at all times. The pump needs a moisture device to reduce the air friction, and should allow a soft something to form a 'u' shape around the nipple to draw out the milk in a sensory way. The hard plastic cones that come on Medela units are less than ideal, and some moms don't respond well (I'm in this bracket). I end up having to massage and pump at the same time and hope I don't lose suction while doing that. 

Thank you for any innovation you can provide for future moms!
