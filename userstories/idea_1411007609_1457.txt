It could go over the shoulders and down to the breasts so it is more comfortable, not awkward to hold/balance, and if it were slim it could be worn under clothes and pumped discreetly. Silicone stuff instead of the hard plastic, because the hard plastic is not comfortable, and quiet, with some plug-in option or a careful way to charge so that suction does not reduce as batteries lose charge. No moldy places.
