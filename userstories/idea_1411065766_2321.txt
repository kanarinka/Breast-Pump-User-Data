I'm very excited this event is happening! I have both ameda and Medea pumps (electric) and a medals manual pump and there are a few things that would be nice to have while pumping 3-4 times a day at work - 

Fewer parts to clean - no one wants to wash pump parts in an office kitchen in front of others, so I use the quick clean wipes. However, there are so many parts that need to be cleaned multiple times a day. And the wipes don't really get in every nook and cranny. 

Quieter pump - even with my office door closed, I'm sure my office "neighbors" know when I'm pumping.

More efficiency - the more ounces I can get out in the least amount of time the better! Pumping takes up a good 20-30 minutes between setting up, pumping, and cleaning. It's very time consuming!

And I don't know what can be done about this but pumping just feels so impersonal. Breast feeding creates an amazing bond between mother and baby. Nothing can replicate that closeness, but pumping goes to the other extreme. It's isolating, awkward, uncomfortable and chilly! 

Thank you in advanced to all involved and I look forward to seeing the results of your efforts!
