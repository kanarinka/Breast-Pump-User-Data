Hi, I have a scenario to add to the topic of making breast pumps not suck. I had to join the workforce suddenly when my son was 9 months old and still nursing. I took a job doing outdoor sales and worked from my car. Needless to say, I had NOWHERE private to pump breastmilk. It was awkward in the car and I actually got interrupted multiple times and had to quickly detach the pump and pull down my shirt so as not to be embarrassed. It would be nice if the pump could be more discreet, not just quieter, but perhaps if it could be put on under the shirt and be small enough that you can hardly tell it's there so you have your hands free and so your shirt isn't up leaving you uncovered and vulnerable. Even if it had be accompanied with a pad or jacket, today's pumps aren't small enough to accomplish what I am asking. And they still require the use of your hands.

Thanks for taking suggestions,

Sincerely...mom of two breasted children,
