Please reconfigure the breast pump to one, hold a charge so that moms can pump anywhere. Two, make it so that either there are fewer parts. Or three, make is to so that parts can be replaced easily (i.e. at a corner store) so that if a mom forgets a piece on a day when she's separated from her baby, she's not out of luck or frantic to replace those parts in the small window of time she has to pump. And four, make it awesome and exciting to use! Thanks!
