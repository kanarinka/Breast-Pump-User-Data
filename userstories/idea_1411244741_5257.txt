Include pieces with the pump that will help prevent milk spillage - at pumping and any pouring stage (I used flanges for funnels, but not all moms know that trick.)
Include hands-free bra (would have to be adjustable for different sizes of moms) with every pump. No one should have to hold a pump up to her body when there are so many good things to do on the Internet. 
A thermometer or timer to alert you when ice pack is melting and cooler is becoming too warm (I work with a girl who forgot to put hers in the fridge after work. Moms forget.)
Include multiple sets of flanges and tubing. 
Include resources for moms to find an LC or hospital to teach her how to use her pump appropriately, how to maintain supply as a pumping mother, how to safely store milk, and how much to feed baby (some poor moms feed waaay more than they can humanly produce because they don't know any better). 
Make pumps last longer or at least explain that they don't in an instruction manual that's friendly to read - with illustrated infographics. 
Make pumps where moms can pass them on to friends. Not everyone can afford them, and every mom should have access. 
Make flanges and tubing easier to clean/sterilize - make them from a material that won't grow bacteria so that mom can rinse with water and use again the next time (less frequent sterilization needed). 
Medela pumps come with 4 bottles for the cooler, but when you buy extras, they come in packs of 3 (don't make me remind you about hotdogs and buns). 
Make pouring out of freezer bags easier (I tipped milk to one side and cut the bottom corner off to create a funnel - functions like using a ziplock bag for icing a cupcake).
Make the outside of the bag more stylish. 
Include the car power supply. 

I was a pumping and working mom for 14 months. We were EBF until 22 months. Ask me anything: rebeccaary@gmail.com.
