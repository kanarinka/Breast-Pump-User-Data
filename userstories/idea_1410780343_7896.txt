Why does the part that goes over the nipple and areola have to be so hard. Can't it be a s Ko fter, more flexible material that better enables a woman's mobility while pumping? If I move wrong, I get stabbed by the hard plastic on the side of the boob or the seal is broken and I lose suction. Pergaps something that doesn't require hands free pumping to be assisted by an awkward bra/tube top looking peice of fabric.
