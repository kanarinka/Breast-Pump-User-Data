I work in an "office" where the wall doesn't go all the way to the ceiling.  I have to pump in my office because my company (a hospital system actually) doesn't provide a lactation room.  My co-workers who sit outside of my office can hear my pump.  Please make it quieter so it is less of an awkward/embarrassing experience.
