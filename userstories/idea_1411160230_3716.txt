I am the President of Spectra Baby USA!  I noticed your campaign for pumps that don't "suck."  This is funny because this is the difference between our pumps and other brands.  Our pumps don't "suck," they suckle!!  This gentle suckling action feels more like a baby and is much more comfortable on the nipples than any other breast pump!  Just ask our moms and they will tell you.  Our pumps massage gently as they express milk! They are also MUCH quieter than our competitors pumps.  Basically takes care of two things on your list that moms are looking for. Would love to send you a sample to try out.  We would love for you to see for yourself why our pumps don't "suck!" Looks like you guys and gals are testing the wrong breast pump!
