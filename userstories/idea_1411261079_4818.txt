There's so much potential to make pumping better. My dream pump would be something you could easily wear all day, turn it on as needed, and use it discretely at any point. This means it needs to be significantly quieter and less bulky than anything on the market today. It would be great to be able to securely pump into a bag without worrying about dropping the precious milk. The fewer parts that need to be washed and sterilized, the better. As a professional, I find my wardrobe options quite limited while pumping - I no longer can wear dresses to work since that would require me to strip down in the lactation room each time I want to pump. Pumping lying down would be great, too. So glad that someone's taking the time to work on this! Now that insurance covers pumps, it seems like the quality is going down. My insurance-issued pump is collecting dust in the basement while I use the significantly better Medela Pump In Style that I had to pay for out of pocket. Thank you!
