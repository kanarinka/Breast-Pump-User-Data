I'm a mom who exclusively pumps as my daughter was not able to breastfeed. A few suggestions I have include putting a timer on the pumps you can set an alarm on so you know when its been 20 minutes (or however long you pump). The pump wouldn't stop afterwards, in case you still need more time. Another suggestion is to allow for more freedom of movement while pumping. While I was still on maternity leave I would be pumping while my daughter was screaming her head off but I couldn't pick her up and soothe her unless I stopped pumping. Talk about stressful! Finally...rechargeable Battery packs as standard please! Its such a pain to have to be near an outlet all the time.
