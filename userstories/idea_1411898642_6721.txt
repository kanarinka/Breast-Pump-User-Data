Wow!  And I'm not amazed that several of my midwife friends are among the winning innovators!  This effort is great.  Yet as a midwife researcher, I'd like to see two important things linked to this effort. First, a "boob-tax" for lack of a better word - any marketing/product that uses women's breasts to promote things OTHER THAN BREASTFEEDING should put in a kitty a small amount of money (like developers do for affordable housing) that can be used as venture capital AND to put this technology into the hands of everyone who wants or needs it.  Second, while a good breast pump is a great supportive technology to enable women to work and breastfeed, we need to ask why women in the U.S. don't have paid maternity leave, 'cause the baby is the best pump.  Need I say it's NOT rocket science, but rather the science of the benefits of breastfeeding, that make a country like Norway declare breast milk a national resource (like oil, only BETTER).  We all could benefit from social policies that support parents caring for their newborns in a sustainable, loving way that includes long-term health benefits that will pay out big time to society long term.
