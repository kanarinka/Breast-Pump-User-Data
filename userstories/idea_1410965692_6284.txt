The Breast Shields.  

I had a hard time in the beginning because the size of the breast shields that came with my machine were "standard" and my breasts were not.  After hours of research online I finally found an article that explained that breast shields come in different sizes depending on your breast/bra cup size.

Maybe a system to measure your breasts and match your ideal breast shields size?

Inexpensive "extenders" that you can put inside the standard breast shields until you can buy your ideal size?
