I know I know!  It could be a little thing that you use when actually nursing that attaches to the baby somehow (details TBD) and somehow siphons off some adjustable fraction of the milk into a bottle or whatever.  The mom would not even know it is there!  Of course it does require having the baby there.  And stuff.
