There should be a place on the bag for you to slide in a business card, like luggage. So that at work in the lactation room you can ID your pump. There should be a place on the bag yo slide in some photos of baby. There should be a little checklist attached to the pump so that as you are packing each day to go to work you can make sure you have all the pieces you need. It would be cool if you could set a timer on the pump.
