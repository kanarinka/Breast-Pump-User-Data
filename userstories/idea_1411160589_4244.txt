Hi. I read about your hackathon on medium.com and was fascinated. My first thought, and one I'm surprised wasn't mentioned in the article, was how awesome it would be to have a pump that worked while lying down.

Probably the most common trait in new moms is exhaustion. Those first weeks are so sleepless and stressful, and I can't tell you the number of times I wished I didn't have to be sitting upright during those long stretches of pumping. I seriously think a change like this would make pumping infinitely easier.

Thanks for doing what you're doing,
