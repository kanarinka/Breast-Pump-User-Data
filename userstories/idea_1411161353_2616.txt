1. My breast pump needs a remote. A small one that just has a start and stop buttons that can hook to my bra strap so I can reach up and pause pumping. I want to feed baby on one side and pump the other simultaneously. It's hard to reach over to the pump if I need to while I'm holding the baby.

2. A touch screen.

3. A timer that will count up or down so I know exactly how long is left if I have a goal or how long I've been pumping.

4. Transmit wirelessly to an app on my phone.

5. I should be able to analyze the milk and tell me the composition. Like if it's foremilk or hindmilk because how am I supposed to tell the difference.

6. A lot of women have let down in a hot shower so there should be an option to warm up the flanges so let down is easier.

7. And a for guide for flanges so you know what size your supposed to use. It can be a fold out booklet with holes in it. And you can stick your nipple in there to find the right size. :)

8.  A self cleaning mode.

9. A nicer looking bag to carry it around in. Some patterns maybe? Or an option to pick patterns like thirty-one bags.

10. My biggest pet peeve is that I have big boobs and to pump I can't sit back and relax. I need to be leaned forward so that the milk runs down into the bottle. If I lean back the milk runs down the funnel thing on onto my shirt. The collection cups should work if you're leaning forward or backwards. I want to sit back in my chair and pump, not be hunched over.

That's all I can think of now. I hate pumping. My pump is expensive and it still sucks. I hope you guys make a better pump soon. We need it!
