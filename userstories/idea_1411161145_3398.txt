Hello,

I really enjoyed reading: https://medium.com/@medialab/the-media-lab-make-the-breast-pump-not-suck-hackathon-513fad8bc451

My venture backed, Silicon Valley based company, Naia Health, has been targeting the pain points you identified during the hackathon.  We have a really strong patent profile covering our technology that is currently  being validating with local mothers.

I would love to speak more about exploring a relationship with your team and my team! We are looking for individuals who believe in this mission to join Naia.

As a mother of three, all of whom I pumped for, I definitely understand the frustrations moms feel with their breast pump experience. We're committed to improving this experience in hopes of increasing the duration infants are provided breast milk.
