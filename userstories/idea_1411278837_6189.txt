I am a IBCLC and a previous pumping mom. When I had my daughter, I was lucky enough to feed her almost exclusively from the breast for the first 6 months. I did have to go back to work after that. It was really hard fitting in every 2 hours of pumping. That sucking sound every second, i will not forget. I cannot even put it into words. It was just so impersonal and breastfeeding to me meant so much more. I did pump because breast milk was an obvious to me. How to improve the pump. I can think of so many ways!! First I think the flanges need to be more rubber and expandable. Every woman does not fit into the perfect nipple size....really? average nipple size? You have such an array of woman and breast sizes, that 24 almost never fits anyone perfect. We need a rubber flange that can really adjust to mom and how her breasts fit. Secondly, we need a pump that doesn't make so much noise!!! That sound, and I think every pumping mom will agree, is so annoying, You feel like a pumped cow! Hey with the new technology now, maybe pumps could have a usb installed and we can listen to our babies laugh or cry or even our favorite songs. Hook our ipods up and listen to what we want. Many studies show when we hear or see our babies we pump more milk!!! 
I wish I new about the hackathon way before because I would have loved to attended!! Please post ideas and inners, it would be great to see what everyone comes up with!!!
