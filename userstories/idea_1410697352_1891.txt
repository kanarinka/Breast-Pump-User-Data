I also made a hand free pumping bra from a sports bra but not due to size. I didn't want to pay the 30+ bucks for one. I paid 3.50 for a cheap one at Walmart cut slots and bang. Hands free. BUT stuck to a desk. Being able to move would be awesome. Especially this time around I'll have to chase a toddler at times.
