Quieter pump motors; a way to lower shirt while pumping; no-spill collection.  If I could magically create a pump that worked and fit my ideal, it would be one that models ostomy devices.  Wear it under my shirt, even while performing other tasks, with a small, discreet motor.  I would be willing to pay for disposable, sterile tubing to accomplish a feat like that.  Even if it couldn't be used in front of someone else secretly, the ability to still look discreet and perhaps be able to switch it off quickly in the event of interruption would be great.  As it stands, I would be exposed and dripping.  Multi-use flanges, perhaps made of flexible silicone and possibly a gentle adhesive?  Bag-based collection system that could be hidden under a shirt?
