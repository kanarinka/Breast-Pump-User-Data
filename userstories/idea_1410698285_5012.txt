Interesting--while I can't speak to which best mimics breastfeeding, I also used the same 3 pumps when I was EPing my second and preferred the Symphony and PIS over the Freestyle by a mile. Never got much production with the Freestyle, always took absolutely forever (50 minutes for a typical session!!), and gave up on it entirely within 2 months. Perhaps this goes to show you how important adjustability is; since every woman responds differently, we either need a better method of testing pumps (some kind of try-before-you-buy program with high interoperability, so that you only need one kit of parts that come into contact with the milk and can then test out various systems to see which works best?), or a single system that is very highly customizable.
