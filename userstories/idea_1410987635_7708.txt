The three things I hated most about pumping:
1) The leaking. The amount of leakage made it difficult to pump anywhere that did not offer a great deal of privacy as well as access to a way to clean up - e.g. paper towels, cloth towels, a change of clothes, etc. Plus in the early stages it was psychologically damaging to work so hard to produce milk, only to have to wipe it up with a paper towel. In the big picture, this was probably a miniscule amount of milk, but it made me sad.

2) The noise. I work in an industry where I am on the phone a lot. On the plus side, it's easier to pump during a conference call than in a meeting, but I was always nervous that everyone on the phone could hear that awful whir-whirring. Why is a breast pump nosier than a washing machine or a dish washer? Also at one point while pumping for my first child, I decided that my pump was screaming "you're crazy, you're crazy." 

3) The bulk and weight. There is so much gear that goes along with a baby, and even just with breastfeeding/pumping. Leaving the house in the morning with my kids, the diaper bag, coats, food, milk, PLUS a pump, empty bottles, ice pack? So heavy. So much crap.

And wait, a fourth thing. I'm not sure if this is because of the design of the pump or just the act of pumping, but sometimes it hurt. Not always, but it was one more reason I dreaded the pump every day.
