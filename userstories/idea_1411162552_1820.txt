Hi,
I haven't read through all of the posts, but so far I haven't seen this idea:
Make pumps more like babies. Babies don't just suck, they use compression. I expressed a lot of milk using just my hands, it was more efficient than the pump in getting milk out of a mostly empty breast, and there is research that hand expression helps increase pump output. It's hard on the hands if you do it for long, so pumps are still a must.
Stanford has an excellent video that explains how it's done http://newborns.stanford.edu/Breastfeeding/HandExpression.html
If a pump could be designed that included suction and compression, it may increase output and may solve some of the issues like not being able to lay down while pumping when it's perfectly fine to lay down while nursing. Right now it doesn't work because the suction comes and goes, and during the non-suction phase, milk would run out. If there is suction and compression, I bet it could make such a seal that it would be easy to move around.
Anyway, thought I'd add this to your pile of ideas!
I love that this is happening - I'm past my pumping days by about 9 years, but I hope new moms will benefit from this.
