Perhaps a pump flange with a rolling mechanism within flange with a removable soft silicone insert that can be washed. This would simulate the peristaltic motion of an infant's tongue in addition to the vacuum created by the pump. I wish I could draw for you what I'm trying to describe here! I imagine the flange also being able to gently adhere to the breast, and rounded so it can be worn under a shirt without attracting too much attention.
