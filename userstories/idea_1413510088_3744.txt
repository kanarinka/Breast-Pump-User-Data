A breast pump must be made that offers dual suction that is variable depending on breast. For all three of my children (the youngest nursling is 8 months) it hurts one breast when using the dual suction on a pump. If I adjust down to comfort the breast that was not irritated by the suction no longer drains and milk production decreases. The alternative would be to alternate breasts which isn't time effective and does not take advantage of dual let down.
